Explanation
Test case-1: Ashish has 50 rupees while the cost of PIZZA is 40. Therefore he can buy a PIZZA for his dinner.
Test case-2: Ashish has 40 rupees. The cost of PIZZA is 55 and the cost of BURGER is 39. Therefore Ashish can not buy a PIZZA but can buy a BURGER for his dinner.
Test case-3: Ashish has 30 rupees which are not sufficient to buy either PIZZA or BURGER. Thus he can not buy anything and remains hungry :(.
