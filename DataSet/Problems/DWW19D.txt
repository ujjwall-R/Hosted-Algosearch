Ruman loves creating software. He has recently created a new open source project which is gaining popularity exponentially. Many skilled developers all across the globe want to contribute to his project. Pull resuests are just flowing in every day. There are a lot of options for Ruman, but he doesn't have time to address each one of them. His project has received pull requests in the past NN days consecutively, and the sequence A1,…,ANA1,…,AN describes the number of requests received each day. Now, he wants to check as many requests as possible but not exceeding K, because there's a limit to everything. And, he wants to pick requests only from a contiguous subsequence of days. If there are multiple such contiguous subsequences for which the pull requests are maximum possible (not exceeding K), then he'll prefer the range of days which starts the earliest.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output:
For each test case print a single line containing three space separated integers L, R and R∑i=LAi.
If it is not possible to find such a contiguous segment, print −1 in a single line.
Constraints:

1≤N≤105
1≤Ai≤109, for each valid i
1≤K≤1014
Sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 106

Subtasks:

10 points:
1≤N≤100
1≤K≤1011
Sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 100
30 points:
1≤N≤103
1≤K≤1012
Sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 103
60 points: original constraints
