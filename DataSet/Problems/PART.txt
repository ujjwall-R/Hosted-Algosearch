Let's define a function P(A)P(A) for a sequence AA as the number of ways to divide AA into contiguous subsequences such that each element of A belongs to exactly one of these subsequences and the sum of elements of each subsequence is between L and R inclusive.
For each integer n between 1 and N inclusive, solve the following problem: Consider a random sequence A with length n where each element is an integer between 1 and K chosen uniformly randomly and independently. Find the expected value of P(A).
For each valid n, it can be proved that the expected value can be expressed as a fraction P/Q, where P and Q are positive integers and Q is coprime with 998,244,353. You should compute P⋅Q−1 modulo 998,244,353, where Q−1 is the multiplicative inverse of Q modulo 998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers N, K, L and R.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers. For each valid i, the i-th of these integers should be P⋅Q−1 modulo 998,244,353 for n=i.
Constraints

1≤T≤20
1≤N≤5⋅105
1≤L≤R≤K≤106
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅105
the sum of K over all test cases does not exceed 106

Explanation
Example case 1: For n=1, we have P([1])=P([2])=1 and P(A)=0 for any other sequence. Hence, the expected value is 2/2=1.
For n=2, there are four valid sequences [1,1], [1,2], [2,1] and [2,2]. Each of them can be split into one-element subsequences. In addition, [1,1] can be left unchanged (split into only one subsequence), so P([1,1])=2. The expected value is (2+1+1+1)/4=5/4=748,683,266.
