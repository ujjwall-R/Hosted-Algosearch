We all know Gru loves Agnes very much. One day Agnes asked Gru to answer some of her queries. She lined up NN minions in a straight line from 11 to NN. 
You are given an array A which contains the height of minions. Agnes will ask him several queries. In each query, Gru has to tell whether the bitwise AND of  A[L…R] is EVEN or ODD. Since Gru is busy planning the biggest heist on Earth, he asks for your help.
Input:

First line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
For each test case:-
First line contains an integer N denoting the number of elements.
Second line contains N spaced integer representing array elements.
Third line contains Q representing number of query.
Next Q lines contains two integer L and R as defined above.

Output:
For each query, output "EVEN" or "ODD" without quotes.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤N≤105
1≤Ai≤105
1≤Q≤105


                        Sample Input 1
                        





1
5
1 3 2 4 5
3
1 2 
1 5
3 4



                        Sample Output 1
                        





ODD
EVEN
EVEN


Explanation

For the first query, the bitwise AND of 1 and 3 is 1, which is Odd. Hence the first output is ODD.
For the third query, the bitwise AND of 2 and 4 is 0, which is Even. Hence the third output is EVEN.
