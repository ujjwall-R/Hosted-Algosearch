Each testcase contains of a single line of input an Integer N. 

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line answer given by Number of Friends that N−th student have. 
Constraints

EXPLANATION:
Example−Test−Case−1:−
Here their is only 1-Student in the class hence he does-not have any other student to make friends.
Example−Test−Case−2:−
Here their are 2-Students in the class, we know that 1st student have 1-friend hence, their is only one possibility of friendship is the friendship among them hence 2nd student have only     1-friend, and that one friend is 1st student.
Example−Test−Case−3:−
Here their are 3-Students in the class.

1st Student have 1-friend.
2nd Student have 2-friends.
hence 3rd-student have only 1-friend so that the friendship become valid. 
Example−Test−Case−4:−
Here their are 4-Students in the class.

1st Student have 1-friend.
2nd Student have 2-friends.
3rd Student have 3-friends.
hence 4th-student have only 2-friend so that the friendship become valid.
