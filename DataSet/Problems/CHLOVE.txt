Chef is in love with his girlfriend chefina.Now,after being in relationship
for so many years chef tries to propose chefina for marriage. Chefina being a 
mathematics lover ,gives a equation of many-one function to chef and put a condition
that she will marry him only when he will be able to find the roots of the given
function in a given range.
f(x)=(x−k1)∗(x−k2)∗(x−k3)∗(x−k4)+Cf(x)=(x−k1)∗(x−k2)∗(x−k3)∗(x−k4)+C
Chefina tells some specific points about function ,i.e.,

the values of k1,k2,k3,k4k1,k2,k3,k4 are integers and  given for each test file.
In a given range (L,R)(L,R) ,there exists more than one roots of a function.
In a given range (L,R), there exists only either a maxima or a minima.
the value of the constant C will be given in each test case.
chef has to print all the roots of a function in a given range.

As, chef is weak in maths he wants your help so that he can marry his love.
Input format:

First line contain 4 space separated pairwise distinct integers ,i.e.,  k1 k2 k3 k4 
Next line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input ,consisting of 3 space separated integers,L,R,C.

Output format:
For each test case ,print all the roots of the function in increasing order in the given range containing space between each two of them
such that: a1 a2 a3 .... an in increasing order i.e.,if there are n roots of a function in a given range.
Constraints

1≤ki≤200
1≤T≤105
−5∗103≤L,R≤5∗103
−3∗106≤C≤107

NOTE: You should round off your answer upto 3 decimal places.Answers with relative error less than 10^-2 will be accepted.
It is also guaranteed that the roots always exists in the given range.
sample input:
1 5 9 10
1
-1 5 0  
sample output:
1 5
