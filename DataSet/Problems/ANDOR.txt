Given an integer xx, find two non-negative integers aa and b such that (a∧b)+(a∨b)=x, where ∧ is the bitwise AND operation and ∨ is the bitwise OR operation.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer x.

Output
If there is no valid pair (a,b), print a single line containing the integer −1. Otherwise, print a single line containing two space-separated integers a and b.
If there are multiple solutions, you may print any one of them.
