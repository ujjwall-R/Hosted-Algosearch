Chef is busy preparing for the next lunchtime, so he has given you the following task.  
You are given an array aa consisting of nn positive integers. The goodnessgoodness of the array a is defined as the GCD of all the elements in the array.
Formally, goodness=GCD(a1,a2,…,an). 
You can perform the following type of operation:

Select any two elements of the array ai and aj (i≠j and 1≤i,j≤n) and replace both ai and aj with ai⋅aj.

You can perform this operation at most once. Find the maximum goodness of the array. 
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n.
The second line contains n space-separated integers a1,a2,…,an.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer representing the maximum goodness of the array.
Constraints

1≤T≤200
2≤n≤2⋅105
1≤ai≤1018
The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105
It is guaranteed that the maximum goodness will not exceed 1018

Explanation
Test Case 1: Choose a3=4 and a4=3. The new array is [18,6,12,12,12] with GCD = 6.
Test Case 2: Choose a1=12 and a3=6. The new array is [72,4,72,16,28] with GCD = 4.
