Chef is a big fan of Coldplay. Every Sunday, he will drive to a park taking MM minutes to reach there, and during the ride he will play a single song on a loop. Today, he has got the latest song which is in total SS minutes long. He is interested to know how many times will he be able to play the song completely.
Input

The first line contains an integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers M,S - the duration of the trip and the duration of the song, both in minutes.

Output
For each test case, output in a single line the answer to the problem.

Explanation

Test case 1: Chef listens to the song once from 0−5 minutes and next from 5−10 minutes.
Test case 2: Chef listens to the song from 0−6 minutes but now he has only 4 minutes left so he can't complete the song again.
Test case 3: Since the song lasts longer than the journey, Chef won't be able to complete it even once.
