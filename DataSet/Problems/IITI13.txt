Right now, Watson is in trouble! He has been locked in a room and the only way to get out of the room is through deciphering a known string to get the password. With his knowledge, he finds out that a given string S can be deciphered with a given cipher array A (1-based index) of same length N as follows: Starting from first number in A (i.e. i=1) the 'i'th character in S, has to be swapped with A[i]th character in S. Help him to get out of the room.

 
Input

First line contains no of test cases T. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of 3 lines:
Length of string N in the first line, the known  string S in the second line, and N space-separated integers of array A in the third line.

Output

For each test case, output in a single line the deciphered text.

 
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ N
Sum of N across all the test cases in a test file will not exceed 10^6
String S contains only lower case English letters
