You are given an integer NN and a digit DD. Find the minimum non-negetive integer you should add to N such that the final value of N does not contain the digit D.
Input Format

The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains two integers N and D on a single line denoting the original number and the digit you need to avoid.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line the minimum non-negetive integer you should add to N.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤N≤109
0≤D≤9

Explanation
Test case 1: N=21 does not contain the digit D=5. Hence there is no need to add any integers to N. 
Test case 2: If 1 is added to N=8, it becomes equal to 9, which does not contain the digit D=8.
Test case 3: The minimum integer you should add to N=100 such that the final value of N does not contain the digit D=0 is 11.
Test case 5: The minimum integer which is greater than 434356 and does not contain the digit D=3 is 440000. So we should add 440000−434356=5644.
