You are given two strings AA, BB made up of upper case and lower case letters.You have to check if they are same. Two strings are samesame if they satisfy both of the following conditions:

|A|=|B| 
Ai=UpperCase(Bi) or Ai=LowerCase(Bi) for every 1≤i≤|A|

If any one of the above conditions is not satisfied then the strings are different. 
Non-matching indices are those indices which violate the 2nd condition.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
First line of each testcase contains string A. 
Second line of each testcase contains string B. 

Output:
For each testcase, if both strings are same then print same, otherwise print different followed by the first non-matching index, on a separate line.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤|A|,|B|≤105
A and B contain upper case and lower case letters only.

Subtasks

5 points : |A| = |B| and both strings contain lower case letters only.
10 points : A and B contain lower case letters only.
85 points : Original Constraints.

Sample Input:
3
Easy
eaSY
One
onePiece
Right
rigid

Sample Output:
same
different 4
different 4

EXPLANATION:

In first case both strings are same.
In second case the strings violate 1st condition so they are different. First 3 indices satisfy 2nd condition but A4 = ′\0′ whereas B4 = ′P′, therefore first non-matching index is 4.
In third case 1st condition is satisfied but 2nd condition is not satisfied. First non-matching index is 4 since A4= ′h′ whereas B4 = ′i′.
