Bear Limak has just gotten his hair cut.
Looking in a mirror, he realized that his fur looks so-so just after a haircut.
After some thinking, he stated that he looks good when his most recent haircut was between A and B days ago (inclusive).
It's guaranteed that A ≥ 1, so Limak doesn't look good on a day of a haircut in particular (you can assume that he gets a haircut in the morning).


After his new realization, Limak decided to plan his haircuts.
Today is the day 0, and he has just gotten a haircut.
For each of the following days, starting from the day 1, he can decide whether to get a haircut or not.
It's allowed to get a haircut many days in a row.


There will be N days that are important for Limak (because he's going to meet a girl he likes).
The i-th of them is the day ti.
Limak wants to look good on as many of those days as possible.


Please, find the maximum possible number of important days when Limak will look good.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers N, A and B, denoting the number of important days and values describing when Limak looks good respectively.


The second line contains N distinct integers t1, t2, ..., tN, denoting important days.
These values are sorted increasingly.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer — the maximum possible number of important days when Limak will look good.

Explanation
Test case 1.
There are 5 important days.
Since Limak had his hair cut on the day 0, he can just wait and he will look good on days 4 through 8 (during that time, the number of days from the most recent haircut will be between A and B).
There are 2 important days (6 and 8) in that interval.
There exists a strategy that allows Limak to look good on 3 important days.
For example, he could get a new haircut on the day 1 — then he will look good on days 5 through 9, including 3 important days.
It turns out that it's impossible that Limak would look good on 4 or more important days.
So the answer is 3.

Test case 2.
Limak should get a haircut on the day 6, to look good on days 12 through 18.
Then he should get a haircut on the day 19, to look good on days 25 through 31.
In total, he will look good on 6 important days: 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 25.
