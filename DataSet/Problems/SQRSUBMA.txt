You are given an integer sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and an integer XX. Consider a N×NN×N matrix B, where Bi,j=Ai+Aj for each valid i and j.
You need to find the number of square submatrices of B such that the sum of their elements is X. Formally, find the number of quartets (x1,y1,x2,y2) such that 1≤x1≤x2≤N, 1≤y1≤y2≤N, x2−x1=y2−y1 and ∑x2i=x1∑y2j=y1Bi,j=X.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and X.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of square submatrices with sum X.
Constraints
