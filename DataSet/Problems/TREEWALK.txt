You are given a tree with N nodes (numbered 1 through N). The tree is rooted at node r. For each node, find the number of walks with length K from the root to this node modulo 998244353.
A walk from node a to node b with length K is defined as a sequence of nodes (u1,u2,…,uK+1), where u1=a,uK+1=b and for each valid i, there is an edge between nodes ui and ui+1. Two walks (u1,u2,…,uK+1) and (v1,v2,…,vK+1) are considered different if there is a valid index i such that ui≠vi.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N denoting the number of nodes in the tree.
Each of the next N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers x and y denoting an edge between nodes x and y.
The last line contains two space-separated integers r and K.

Output
Print a single line containing N space-separated integers. For each valid i, the i-th of them should denote the number of walks from node r to node i with length K, modulo 998244353.

Explanation
