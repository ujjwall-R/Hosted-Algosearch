You are given a directed weighted graph with PP vertices, labelled from 00 to P−1. P is a prime number. You are also given an integer K. 
For each vertex u, there is an edge from vertex u to vertex (K⋅u+i)modP for all 0≤i≤K−1. The weight of an edge directed from the vertex u to the vertex (K⋅u+i)modP is equal to i.  
You will be given Q queries. In each query you will be given two vertices X and Y and you have to determine the minimum cost of going from X to Y. If a path does not exists between X and Y, print −1.
Input Format

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases T. The description of T testcases as follows.
The first line of each test contains 3 space separated integers P,K,Q.
Then Q lines follow. Each of the Q lines contains two space separated integers X and Y denoting a query.

Output Format
For each query print a single integer denoting the minimum cost of going from X to Y. If a path does not exist print −1.
