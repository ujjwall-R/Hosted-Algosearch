You are given a string SS, consisting of lowercase English letters. You can do the following operation at most once :

Choose a subsequence of the string SS, then remove it from S and concatenate the subsequence at the end of the remaining string. 

Find the lexicographically minimum string that can be obtained by performing this operation at most once on S.
Note that:

A string A is a subsequence of a string B if A can be obtained by deleting several (possibly, zero or all) characters from B.
Given two strings of the same length A and B, we say that A is lexicographically smaller than B if there exists an index i such that A1=B1,A2=B2,…,Ai−1=Bi−1 and  Ai<Bi.

Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a string S.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing the lexicographically minimum string which can be obtained from S by performing the given operation at most once.
Constraints

1≤T≤2⋅105
1≤|S|≤105
S contains only lowercase English letters.
Sum of |S| over all test cases does not exceed 106.

Explanation
Test case 1: It is optimal to choose the subsequence b, then remove and concatenate the subsequence at the end of the remaining string aa. Hence the final string is aa+b=aab.
Test case 2: The given string is already lexicographically minimum.
Test case 3: It is optimal to choose the subsequence ccdef, then remove and concatenate the subsequence at the end of the remaining string bb. Hence the final string is bb+ccdef=bbccdef.
