You are given an array AA of length NN. 
You can perform the following operation on the array, as long as it has more than one element:

Choose any two adjacent elements, remove them from the array and insert their sum at that position.
Formally, if the current length of the array is |A|, you can choose an index 1≤i<|A|, and transform the array into [A1,A2,…,Ai−1,Ai+Ai+1,Ai+2,…,AN].

Note that after each operation, the length of array decreases by exactly 1.
Print the minimum number of operations to be applied on array A such that all the elements in the resulting array are equal. See sample explanation for more details.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line contains an integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers, the elements of array A.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the minimum number of operations required to make all the elements equal.
Constraints

1≤T≤104
2≤N≤3⋅104
−3⋅104≤Ai≤3⋅104
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅104

Explanation
Test case 1: It is optimal to remove A2 and A3 in the first operation, after which the array becomes [5,5] — all of whose elements are equal.
Test case 2: Remove A1 and A2 after which the array becomes [15], which contains equal elements because it is of length 1.
Test case 3: First remove A3 and A4 after which the updated array A becomes [3,6,9,9]. Now remove A1 and A2 after which the array becomes [9,9,9]. 
Test case 4: The array elements are already equal.
