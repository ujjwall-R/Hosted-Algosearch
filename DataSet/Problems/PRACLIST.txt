CodeChef recently revamped its practice page to make it easier for users to identify the next problems they should solve by introducing some new features: 

Recent Contest Problems - contains only problems from the last 2 contests
Separate Un-Attempted,  Attempted, and All tabs
Problem Difficulty Rating - the Recommended dropdown menu has various difficulty ranges so that you can attempt the problems most suited to your experience
Popular Topics and Tags

Explanation
Test case 1: There are 10 problems in total in the Beginner's section, out of which 4 have been attempted. Hence, there are 6 Un-attempted problems.
Test case 2: There are 10 problems in total in the Beginner's section, out of which all have been attempted. Hence, there are 0 Un-attempted problems.
Test case 3: There are 1000 problems in total in the Beginner's section, out of which 990 have been attempted. Hence, there are 10 Un-attempted problems.
Test case 4: There are 500 problems in total in the Beginner's section, out of which only 1 has been attempted. Hence, there are 499 Un-attempted problems.
