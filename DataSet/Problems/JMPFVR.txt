Chef has a tree with NN nodes (numbered 11 through NN). Each node has a value; let's denote the value of node i by vi. Chef likes to travel in this tree. For each pair of nodes (u,v), he defines the score of the path from u to v in the following way:

Suppose that the simple path from node u to node v is a sequence of nodes u=a0,a1,…,aL=v, where L is the length of this path.
Let's denote the values of the nodes on this path by a sequence A0,A1,…,AL, where for each valid i, Ai=vai.
Next, let's denote the suffix sums of the sequence A by S0,S1,…,SL, i.e. for each valid i, Si=∑Lj=iAj.
The score f(u,v) of the path from node u to node v is the sum of all these suffix sums, i.e. f(u,v)=∑Li=0Si.

Chef wants to choose some nodes u and v (u≠v) and travel along the simple path from u to v. However, he can treat it as several consecutive paths, which affects the score of the resulting trip. Specifically, if the simple path from node u to node v is a sequence of nodes u=a0,a1,…,aL=v, then Chef may choose any non-negative integer m and any sequence k1,k2,…,km such that 1≤k1<k2<…km<L; then, the score of the trip from u to v is f(u,ak1)+f(ak1,ak2)+…+f(akm,v). Specifically, if m=0, the score of the trip is simply f(u,v).
Find the maximum possible score of Chef's trip if the nodes u and v (such that u≠v) and the sequence k are chosen optimally.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers v1,v2,…,vN.
N−1 lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers a and b denoting that nodes a and b are connected by an edge.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum possible score.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
2≤N≤3⋅105
|vali|≤105 for each valid i
1≤a,b≤N

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (50 points): the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 103
Subtask #2 (50 points): original constraints
Example Input

3
-10 2 4
1 2
1 3

Example Ouput
-2

Explanation
Example case 1: We have f(1,2)=−6, f(2,1)=−18, f(1,3)=−2, f(3,1)=−16, f(2,3)=−6 and f(3,2)=−10. A trip from node 2 to node 3 can be split into the paths 2→1→3 with score −20, and a trip from node 3 to node 2 can be split into the paths 3→1→2 with score −22. Each trip can also be treated as one path. The maximum score is −2 for the trip from node 1 to node 3.
