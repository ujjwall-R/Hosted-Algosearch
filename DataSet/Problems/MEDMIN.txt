JJ loves playing with medians. He has an array AA of length NN (NN is odd). He wants to partition the array A into two non-empty subsets P and Q such that the value of |median(P)−median(Q)| is as small as possible. (Note that each Ai must belong to either subset P or subset Q).
Help him find this minimum value of |median(P)−median(Q)|.
As a reminder, the median of a subset X of size N is the element which occupies the ⌊N+12⌋th position after we sort the elements in non-decreasing order. For example, median([3,1,4])=3, median([3,1,4,2])=2. (Here ⌊x⌋ denotes the largest integer which does not exceed x).
Input Format

The first line contains T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the size of the array A.
The second line of each test case contains N space separated integers A1,A2,…,AN denoting the array A.

Output Format
Output the minimum value of |median(P)−median(Q)|.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
3≤N≤999
1≤Ai≤109
N is odd.

Explanation

Test case 1: We can divide the array into following two subsets: P=[2,8],Q=[7,4,2], which has |median(P)−median(Q)|=|2−4|=2. It can be proven that the answer can not be improved further.
Test case 2: We can divide the array into following two subsets: P=[1,3],Q=[2], which has |median(P)−median(Q)|=|1−2|=1. It can be proven that the answer can not be improved further.
Test case 3: Observe that, for any partition of the array into any two non-empty subsets, the median of both the subsets will be 1. Therefore the answer is |1−1|=0.
