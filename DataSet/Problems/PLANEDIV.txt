Chef is working with lines on a 2-D plane.
He knows that every line on a plane can be clearly defined by three coefficients A, B and C: any point (x, y) lies on the line if and only if A * x + B * y + C = 0.
Let's call a set of lines to be perfect if there does not exist a point that belongs to two or more distinct lines of the set.
He has a set of lines on a plane and he wants to find out the size of the largest perfect subset of this set.
Input
The first line of input contains one integers T denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one integer N denoting number of lines.
Next N lines contain 3 space-separated integers each denoting coefficients A, B and C respectively.
Output
For each test case output the cardinality of the largest perfect subset in a single line.
Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ Nmax
Sum over all N for all test cases ≤ NSmax
|A|, |B|, |C| ≤ 109
For a line with coefficients A, B and C either A or B is not zero.
Subtasks
Subtask #1 [35 points]: Nmax = 5000, NSmax = 50000
Subtask #2 [65 points]: Nmax = NSmax = 105

Explanation
Lines 3*x + 4*y + 5 = 0 and 30*x + 40*y + 0 = 0 form a biggest perfect subset.
