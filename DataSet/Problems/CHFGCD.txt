Chef has two positive integers XX and YY. Now Chef wants to perform some number of operations (possibly zero) on them. In each operation, Chef can choose either X or Y and increment it by 1. Find the minimum number of operations Chef needs to perform so that there is a positive integer strictly greater than 1 which divides both X and Y (In other words, the greatest common divisor of X and Y should be greater than 1).
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers X and Y.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of operations Chef needs to perform.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤X,Y≤109

4 16
4 55



                        Sample Output 1

1


Explanation
Test Case 1: The greatest common divisor of 4 and 16 is 4 which is already greater than 1, so Chef will not perform any operations.
Test Case 2: Chef will perform one operation and add 1 to 55. Now the greatest common divisor of 4 and 56 is 4 which is greater than 1.
