On a planet called RUIZ LAND, which is ruled by the queen, Erika Ruiz. Each person on that planet has a strength value (strength value >0).
That planet has a special rule made by the queen that a boy and a girl will form a couple if their Hate value is a prime number where Hate is given by the formula:-
Hate = (boy's strength value)  XOR (girl's strength value )
You are given N numbers denoting the strength value of N girls, and each of the N girls has to form a couple with a boy such that sum of Hate value of all the N couples will be minimum.
You need to print the strength value of each boy, Where the boy at index i will form a couple with the girl at index i, where 1≤i≤N.
Assume that you can always find at least one boy having that strength for each girl.
Input:

First line will contain N, the number of Girls. 
Next line contains N numbers separated by space denoting strength value for each girl.

Output:
Print the required N numbers denoting strength of boys.
Constraints

1≤N≤100000
1≤Ai≤109 , (where 1≤i≤N) and Ai denotes strength of i'th girl.

Sample Input:
2
10 16

Sample Output:
8 18
