A (11-indexed) binary string SS of length N is called a xor palindrome if the value of Si⊕S(N+1−i) is the same for all 1≤i≤N.
For example, 0, 1111 and 0101 are xor palindromes, while 1110 and 110101 are not.
You are given a binary string S of length N. Determine if it is possible to rearrange it to form a xor palindrome or not.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N — the length of the binary string S.
The second line of each test case contains the binary string S containing 0s and 1s only.

Output Format
For each test case, output YES if it is possible to rearrange S to convert it into a xor palindrome. Otherwise output NO.
You may print each character of YES and NO in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, Yes will be considered identical).
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤105
S is a binary string, i.e, contains only the characters 0 and 1
It is guaranteed that the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

Explanation
Test case 1: 00 is already a xor palindrome. [The value of Si⊕S(N+1−i) is 0 for all 1≤i≤N.]
Test case 2: 0011 is already a xor palindrome. [The value of Si⊕S(N+1−i) is 1 for all 1≤i≤N.]
Test case 3: 001 can be rearranged to form 010 which is a xor palindrome. [The value of Si⊕S(N+1−i) is 0 for all 1≤i≤N.]
Test case 4: It can be proved that 0001 can not be rearranged to form a xor palindrome.
