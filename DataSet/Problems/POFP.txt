Consider any way to pair the integers 11 through 2N2N into N pairs (A1,B1),(A2,B2),…,(AN,BN) in such a way that each of these integers is present in exactly one pair, Ai<Bi for each valid i and A1<A2<…<AN. Let's call such a sequence of pairs a pairing.
For a pairing (A1,B1),(A2,B2),…,(AN,BN), we can create an undirected graph with 2N nodes (numbered 1 through 2N) and the following edges:

first type: for each valid i, an edge between nodes i and i+1
second type: for each valid i, an edge between nodes Ai and Bi

This pairing is valid if for each edge (i,i+1) of the first type, there is an edge of the second type (Aj,Bj) which "surrounds" it, i.e. satisfies Aj≤i and Bj>i. The cost of a valid pairing is defined as the number of pairs of edges of the second type such that one of these edges is "nested" in the other, i.e. pairs (Ai,Bi) and (Aj,Bj) such that Ai<Aj<Bj<Bi.
Find the sum of costs of all valid pairings. Since this number may be very large, compute it modulo a given prime P.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and P.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the sum of costs of all valid pairings modulo P.
Constraints

Explanation
Example case 1: For N=2, there are two valid pairings [(1,3),(2,4)] and [(1,4),(2,3)], with costs 0 and 1 respectively.
Example case 2: For N=3, all valid pairings along with their costs are listed below. 

[(1,4),(2,5),(3,6)] with cost 0
[(1,4),(2,6),(3,5)] with cost 1
[(1,5),(2,4),(3,6)] with cost 1
[(1,5),(2,6),(3,4)] with cost 2
[(1,6),(2,5),(3,4)] with cost 3
[(1,6),(2,4),(3,5)] with cost 2
[(1,3),(2,6),(4,5)] with cost 1
[(1,3),(2,5),(4,6)] with cost 0
[(1,6),(2,3),(4,5)] with cost 2
[(1,5),(2,3),(4,6)] with cost 1

The sum of all costs is 13 and its remainder modulo 5 is 3.
