Chef has K friends (numbered 1 through K) and an array of length N in which each element has a color; initially, each element has color 0. Chef agreed to let each of his friends (in the order from friend 1 to friend K) perform the following operation:

choose an arbitrary non-empty subarray
paint all elements in this subarray with color i, where i is the number of this friend


When an element is painted with some color, its original color is lost. This happens even if this element was already painted by some friend before.
Chef is now wondering: how many distinct colorings of the final array are possible?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of possible final arrays modulo 163577857.

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 106
1 ≤ sum of N over all test cases ≤ 5 · 106

Explanation
Example case 1: the final array can be [0, 1], [1, 0] or [1, 1].
Example case 2: the final array can be [0, 2], [1, 2], [2, 0], [2, 1] or [2, 2].
Example case 3: the final array can be [0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0] or [1, 1, 1].
