Sereja has an array A that contains n integers: A1, A2, ..., An. 
Sereja also has an array B that contains n integers B1, B2, ..., Bn. 
In a single step Sereja can choose two indexes i and j (1 <= i <= j <= n) , and increase all the elements of A with indices between i and j inclusively by one, modulo 4.
In other words, we make Ap equal to (Ap + 1) modulo 4 if p is an integer from the range [i; j].
Now Sereja is interested in the following question: what is the mininal number of steps necessary in order to make the array A equal to the array B.
Input
The first line contains an integer T - the number of the testcases. Then, T tests follow. 
The first line of each testcase contains the integer n. 
The next line conatins n single space separated integers - A1, A2, ..., An. 
The next line conatin n single space separated integers - B1, B2, ..., Bn.
Output
For each testcase output an answer - the mininal number of steps necessary.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ n ≤ 105
0 ≤ Ai, Bi ≤ 3



Example
Input:
1
5
2 1 3 0 3
2 2 0 1 0

Output:
1
