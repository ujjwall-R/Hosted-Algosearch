You are given a string SS with length NN that contains only the 26 lowercase English letters. You are also given a sequence W1,W2,…,W26 of weights corresponding to these letters in the order from 'a' to 'z', i.e. W1 is the weight of 'a', W2 is the weight of 'b' and so on.
We define the weight of a string as the sum of weights of all characters present in it. If a character occurs multiple times in this string, its weight is also counted multiple times.
Next, we define the power of a string s as the sum of weights of all strings r such that s can be represented as r+r+…+r+p, where + denotes string concatenation and p is a prefix of r (possibly empty).
Consider a contiguous substring of S chosen uniformly randomly among all its N(N+1)/2 contiguous substrings. Find the expected value of the power of such a substring. The expected power can be represented as a fraction P/Q, where P and Q are positive integers and Q is coprime with 998,244,353. You should calculate P⋅Q−1 modulo 998,244,353, where Q−1 denotes the multiplicative inverse of Q modulo 998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single string S.
The second line contains 26 space-separated integers W1,W2,…,W26.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer P⋅Q−1 modulo 998,244,353.

Explanation
Let W(s) and P(s) denote the weight and power of a string s respectively.
Example case 1: There are 3 contiguous substrings "a", 2 contiguous substrings "aa" and 1 contiguous substring "aaa".

"a" is chosen with probability 3/6; we have P(a)=W(a)=1
"aa" is chosen with probability 2/6; P(aa)=W(a)+W(aa)=1+2=3
"aaa" is chosen with probability 1/6; P(aaa)=W(a)+W(aa)+W(aaa)=1+2+3=6

The expected power is (3⋅1+2⋅3+1⋅6)/6=15/6.
Example case 2: The contiguous substrings are "a", "b", "ab", "ba", "aba", "bab", "abab"; the first three of them occur twice. We have P(a)=W(a)=1, P(b)=W(b)=2, P(ab)=W(ab)=1+2=3, P(ba)=W(ba)=3, P(aba)=W(ab)+W(aba)=3+4=7, P(bab)=W(ba)+W(bab)=3+5=8 and P(abab)=W(ab)+W(abab)=3+6=9.
The expected power is (2⋅P(a)+2⋅P(b)+2⋅P(ab)+P(ba)+P(aba)+P(bab)+P(abab))/10=39/10.
