You've got an MCQ Assignment sheet of Descriptive Statistics to finish before tomorrow morning. the sheet only includes only 1 type of Question but with Different data fields in each question.

Question - Distance of top of bars from X-axis is given to you. Plot the Graph for given data
   and find the Volume of Graph that can be filled with any fluid.

You don't want to do the same calculation so many times since you're short on time. So you decide to write an algorithm that calculates the Volume of a graph. 
Note - Assume an elevetion Graph where width of each bar is 1.
 Now go write the Algorithm and help yourself.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The description of T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N i.e. number of walls.
The second line contains N space-separated integers D1,D2…DN height of each wall.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer
― the volume of water that  could be hold in tank.
Constraints
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= Di <= 10^5

Explanation
Sample 1 :
1+3+1+3+2+2+3 = 15 units on bars {3,5,6,7,10,11,12} respectively.  
 
Sample 2 :
1+1+4+1+1 = 6  units on bars {3,5,6,7,10} respectively ( on 1 unit Scale ).
