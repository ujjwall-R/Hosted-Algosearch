"I have only one rule, never submit partially correct code" -Barney Stinson
The religious act which Barney and his friends hold most sacred, XORING the natural numbers in the given range. This time Barney is a bit busy with picking up some girls, so he asked you to help him. He gave you two numbers LL and RR, you have to find if XOR of all the numbers in range L to R (L,R both inclusive) is odd or even.
Warning!! Large Input-Output. Please use Fast IO.
Input:

The first line will contain TT, number of testcases. 
Each testcase contains a single line of input, two integers L,R. 

Output:
For each testcase, in the new line print "Odd" if the XOR in the range is odd, else print "Even".
Constraints

1≤T≤106
1≤L≤R≤1018

Explanation
Test case -1 -> XOR (1,2,3,4) =4
Test case -2 -> XOR (2,3,4,5,6) =6
Test case -3 -> XOR (3) =3
Test case -4 -> XOR (2,3) =1
