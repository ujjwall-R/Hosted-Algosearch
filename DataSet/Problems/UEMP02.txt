 
In a school there are N student .On the occation of annual function for each Si
where 1<=i<=N student givent Ti tasks and difference between tasks of two consecutive students are same and (i+1)the student must get more task than ith student.
School have M number of task. Your task is find out whether task distribution is possible or impossible.
 
Input

 The first line contains two integers N number sudent in school
and M Total Number of task

 
Output

For each test case, output a single line "possible" distribution is possible otherwise "impossible".

 
Constraints

1 <= N <= 100
1 <= M <= 10000
1 <= Difference Between tasks of two consecutive student  <= 100
1 <= Max Number of Task Given to First student <= 100

 
Example
Input:#1
5 15
Output:
possible
 
Input:#2
4 8
Output:
impossible
 
Explanation

In the first test case N is 5 and M is 5. The possible distribution is 1 2 3 4 5.
here the different between task of two consecutive student is 1;
In the second test case N is 4 and M is 8.The minimum task reqired to disribute between students 10 i.e.
 is 1,2,3,4. So distribution of task is impossible.
