You are given an integer NN.  
Your task is to find any two integers A,BA,B such that 1≤A,B≤2∗N1≤A,B≤2∗N and difference of A and B exactly equals to N i.e. A−B=N.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N. 

Output:

For each testcase, output two space-separated integers A,B in newline.

Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤N≤109

Sample Input:
2
5
6

Sample Output:
6 1
7 1

EXPLANATION:
Test case 1 : If we choose A = 6 and B = 1 then A - B = 5.
Note :  A = 7 and B = 2 is also a valid answer but A = 11 and B = 6 not because 11 > 2*N.
Test case 2 : If we choose A = 7 and B = 1 then A - B = 6.
