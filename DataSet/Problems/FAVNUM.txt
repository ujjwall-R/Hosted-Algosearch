Chef likes numbers and number theory, we all know that. There are N digit strings that he particularly likes. He likes them so much that he defines some numbers to be beautiful numbers based on these digit strings. 

Beautiful numbers are those numbers whose decimal representation contains at least one of chef's favorite digit strings as a substring.
Your task is to calculate the Kth smallest number amongst the beautiful numbers in the range from L to R (both inclusive). 
If the number of beautiful numbers between L and R is less than K, then output "no such number".

Input
In the first line of input there will be integers L, R, K and N.
Then N lines follow. Each line will contain a single string of decimal digits.

Output
Output one integer - the solution to the problem described above or a string "no such number" if there is no such number.


Constraints
1<=L<=R<=10^18
1<=K<=R-L+1
1<=N<=62
1<=The length of any Chef's favourite digit string<=18. Each string begins with a nonzero digit.


Example
Input:
1 1000000000 4 2
62
63

Output:
163


Input:
1 1 1 1
2

Output:
no such number


Input:
1 1000 15 2
6
22

Output:
67
