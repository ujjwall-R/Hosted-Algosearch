Gotham City is the home of Batman, and Batman likes to keep his people together. 
There are N houses in the city. The resident of the ith house is of type Ai. It is known that people of the same type are friends and people of different types are not friends. 
To maintain peace, Batman can do the following type of operation:

Choose indices i and j (1≤i≤j≤N) and reverse the substring A[i,j]. 

Determine the length of the longest range of friends after applying at most k operations on the string for all 0≤k≤N.
Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, the number of houses in Gotham city.
The next line contains a string A with N characters. The ith character denotes the type of the ith person.

Output Format
For each test case, output a single line, (N+1) space-separated integers where the ith integer signifies the length of the longest range of friends after applying  at most i operations.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤2⋅105
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.
String A contains lowercase English alphabets only.

4 4 4 4 4
1 2 2 2 2
2 3 4 4 4 4 4 4


Explanation
Test case 1: All 4 people are friends. Thus, the answer is 4 for all values of k.
Test case 2: 

For k=0, the length of the longest range of friends is 1.
For k=1, we can choose i=1 and j=3. On reversing the substring [1,3], we get cbaa. Thus, length of longest range of friends is 2.
For k=2,3, and 4, the length of the longest range of friends is 2 as no more people of the same type can be grouped together.
