You are given a matrix B with size N × N. Each element of this matrix is an integer from the set {-1, 0, 1}.


Determine if it's possible to express B as A · AT, where A is a matrix of integers with size N × N. (Here, AT is the transpose of A; see below for its definition.) If it is possible, find the lexicographically smallest A such that B = A · AT.


The transpose of a matrix is created by flipping that matrix around its main diagonal — formally, the element at row i and column j of matrix AT is the same as the element at row j and column i of matrix A, for each valid i, j. For more details, see Wikipedia.

For two matrices C and D with size N × N, we will say that C is lexicographically smaller than D if the sequence c = C1,1, C1,2, ..., C1,N, C2,1, C2,2, ..., C2,N, ..., CN,1, ..., CN,N is lexicographically smaller than d = D1,1, D1,2, ..., D1,N, D2,1, D2,2, ..., D2,N, ..., DN,1, ..., DN,N. That is, there must be a valid index i such that ci and di differ, and the smallest such index must satisfy ci < di.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The next N lines describe matrix B. Each of these lines contains N space-separated integers. The j-th integer on the i-th line denotes Bi,j, the element at row i and column j of B.

Output
For each test case:

If no valid matrix A exists, print a single line containing the integer -1.
Otherwise, print N lines; each of them should contain N space-separated integers.
The j-th integer on the i-th line should denote the element at row i and column j of matrix A.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
2 ≤ N ≤ 1000
-1 ≤ Bi,j ≤ 1 for each valid i, j
sum of N for all test cases ≤ 1000

Explanation
Example case 1: You can check by brute force that this is the lexicographically smallest possible valid matrix A.
