Nadaca is a country with N cities. These cities are numbered 1 through N and connected by M bidirectional roads. Each city can be reached from every other city using these roads.
Initially, Ryan is in city 1. At each of the following K seconds, he may move from his current city to an adjacent city (a city connected by a road to his current city) or stay at his current city. Ryan also has Q conditions (a1,b1),(a2,b2),…,(aQ,bQ) meaning that during this K-second trip, for each valid i, he wants to be in city ai after exactly bi seconds.
Since you are very good with directions, Ryan asked you to tell him how many different trips he could make while satisfying all conditions. Compute this number modulo 109+7. A trip is a sequence of Ryan's current cities after 1,2,…,K seconds.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M and K.
Each of the next M lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting a road between cities u and v.
The next line contains a single integer Q.
Q lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤Q), the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers ai and bi.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of trips Ryan can make, modulo 109+7.
