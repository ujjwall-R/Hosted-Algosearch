Consider an array AA with NN positive integers. 
Let B be defined as an array of N integers such that for each 1≤i≤N:

Bi=Ai−1, if Ai is even.
Bi=Ai+1, if Ai is odd. 

You are given an array C of size 2⋅N which is formed by taking all the elements of the arrays A and B and rearranging them.
You need to find the number of distinct arrays A whose sum of elements is K, from which C can be obtained.
Note: Two arrays X and Y are considered to be distinct if there exists no rearrangement of X which is the same as Y.
Since the final answer can be very large, print the answer modulo 109+7.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K - the parameters mentioned in the statement.
The second line of each test case contains 2⋅N space-separated integers C1,C2,…,C2N denoting the array C.

Output Format
For each test case, output the number of distinct arrays A such that the sum of its elements is K. Print the answer modulo (109+7).
Constraints

1≤T≤103
1≤N≤103
1≤Ci≤2⋅103
1≤K≤2⋅106
Sum of N over all the test cases does not exceed 103.

Explanation
Test case 1: If A=[1,3], then B=[2,4]. C=[1,2,3,4] can be obtained by rearranging the elements of A and B. It can be proven that A=[1,3] is the only such distinct array whose elements sum to 4. Thus the answer is 1.
Note that arrays [1,3] and [3,1] are not distinct.
Test case 2: 

If A=[2,3], then B=[1,4]. C=[1,2,3,4] can be obtained by rearranging the elements of A and B.
If A=[1,4], then B=[2,3]. C=[1,2,3,4] can be obtained by rearranging the elements of A and B.

It can be proven that [2,3] and [1,4] are the only such distinct arrays whose elements sum to 5. Thus the answer is 2.
