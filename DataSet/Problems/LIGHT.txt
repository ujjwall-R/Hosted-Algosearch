There are N lights above a road along the X-axis.
The i-th light has Xi as its X-coordinate, and it is hung Yi above the road.
The i-th light illuminates a triangular area, which is an isosceles triangle and its bottom edge is on the X-axis.
The half of the top angle of the triangle is Zi degrees. (See the below figure)


You have an aircraft which can fly on a fixed height.
Because of some unknown reasons, this aircraft can fly only under the light.
Your task is to find the maximum possible height for your flight from X=L to X=R.


The lights do not block the aircraft, e.g. the aircraft can safely fly through a light.


Input

The first line contains three parameters N, L and R.


The next N lines give the infomation about each light.
The i-th line contains three numbers Xi, Yi and Zi.

Output

Output the maximum height you can reach.
The value must have an absolute error less than or equal to 0.000001 (10-6).
It is guarenteed that you can make the flight with the positive height.

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 50000
-1000 ≤ L < R ≤ 1000
-1000 ≤ Xi ≤ 1000
0 < Yi ≤ 1000
15 ≤ Zi ≤ 75N is an integer, but all other input values can be non-integers.
