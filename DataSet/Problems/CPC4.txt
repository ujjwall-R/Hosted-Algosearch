SemCrack is hosting a campus drive for emerging programmers, there are N number of programmers who  attended the drive and their skills are as follows S[0], S[1].....S[N-1] (assume 0 based indexing). Company has it's set of protocols to select the programmer which are as follows:

Campus has set a condition that a programmer can only be selected, if his/her skills are strictly greater than K, which is defined by company.

There are Q number of queries that need to be executed. These queries may be of following two types:

1 X Y (0 ≤ X ≤ N-1) - Replace the value of Xth array element by Y. 
2 L R (1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N-1) - Return the number of selected programmers in this range.


Input

The first line contains two space separated positive integers N and K denoting the total number of programmers and K condition which is defined by company.Next line contains the skills of programmers S[0], S[1]......S[N-1].Next line contains an integer Q number of queries.
Each of the next Q lines contains one of the two queries described above.

 
Output
For each query of type 2, print the required answer in a new line.
 
Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ S[i] ≤ 108
1 ≤ Q ≤ 106
0 ≤ X ≤ N-1
1 ≤ Y, K ≤ 108
0 ≤ L  ≤  R  ≤ N-1

 
Subtasks
Subtask #1 (20 points):
1 ≤ N ≤ 104
1 ≤ Q ≤ 103

Subtask #2 (30 points):
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ Q ≤ 105
Subtask #3 (50 points): original constraints

2 0 3
1 4 7
1 6 7
2 1 1

Explanation
Example case 1.
First you have an array S = {2, 4, 7, 6, 7, 2, 4, 2, 5, 1}
Query 1.
Number of selected programmers in range [0, 3]
There are three programmer having skills greater then K
2, 4, 7So answer is 3.
Query 2.
Replace value of 4th  element with 7.
S = {2, 4, 7, 6, 7, 2, 4, 2, 5, 1}
Query 3.
Replace value of 6th  element with 7.
S = {2, 4, 7, 6, 7, 2, 4, 7, 5, 1}
Query 4.
Number of selected programmers in range [1, 1]
There is only one programmer having skills greater then K
4So answer is 1.
Query 5.
Replace value of 5th  element with 8.
S = {2, 4, 7, 6, 7, 2, 4, 7, 8, 1}
