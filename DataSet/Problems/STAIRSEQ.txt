Virat Kohli loves integer sequences very much. He especially likes stairs(he barely uses lifts).
Sequence a1, a2, …, an is stairs if there is such index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), that the following condition is met: a1 < a2 < … < ai - 1 < ai > ai + 1 > … > a|a| - 1 > a|a|.
For example, sequences [1, 2, 3, 2] and [4, 2] are stairs and sequence [3, 1, 2] isn't.
Kohli spending his quarantine so he not filled bored so he given a task to his best friend ABD to utilize some time, but ABD wants your help so do it guys. Ee sala cup namde.
You have given a number n and you have to make a stair sequence.  A stair sequence is a sequence in which either numbers (first strictly increase and then decrease) or (numbers should strictly decrease).
For Example:
6
1 1 2 2 3 3
Ans: 1 2 3 2 1
First sequence is strictly increasing till '3' and then starts decreasing till '1', this a stair sequence.  
Input: -
The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 102) — total number of stairs size. The second line contains n integers bi (1 ≤ bi ≤ 500) — the numbers on the Stairs.
Output: -
Print the resulting stairs  
Example: -
Input: -
6
1 1 2 2 3 3
Output: -
1 2 3 2 1
