Given an integer NN, help Chef in finding an NN-digit odd positive integer X such that X is divisible by 3 but not by 9.
Note: There should not be any leading zeroes in X. In other words, 003 is not a valid 3-digit odd positive integer.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of testcases. The description of the T testcases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N, denoting the number of digits in X.

Output Format
For each testcase, output a single line containing an N-digit odd positive integer X in decimal number system, such that X is divisible by 3 but not by 9.
Constraints

1≤T≤500
1≤N≤104
The sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105

Explanation
Test Case 1: 3 is the only 1-digit odd positive integer which is divisible by 3 but not by 9.
Test Case 2: 15 is a 2-digit odd positive integer which is divisible by 3 but not by 9. 21 is also a valid answer, among others. Note that 03 is not a valid answer as there should not be any leading zeroes in the output.
