Given a string of length NN consisting of lowercase alphabets and a pivot index PP (11-based index).
Substring from Pth character till end is immutable while the following operations can be done on substring on the left of the Pth index:

 Insert a character.
 Delete a character.
 Rearrange the characters.

Cost of insertion and deletion is 1 while rearranging characters has no cost.
Using above operations you need to form new string which will be palindrome about Pth character or Pth and (P+1)th characters of the original string.
What is the minimum cost of operations for above task?

Input:
First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, a string and P space seperated. 

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line answer i.e. minimum cost of operations.

Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤105
1≤P≤N

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (100 points): Original Constraints

Sample Input:
1
bacb 2

Sample Output:
1

EXPLANATION:
Insert c on just left to a. New string will be bcacb which is palindrome. Cost: 1
