Chef finished inviting all of his friends. Now it is time to get a tree in his house and decorate it for the party. He wants to use the most beautiful tree ever.
The tree Chef chose has N nodes (numbered 1 through N) and it is rooted at node 1. For each valid i, the initial colour of the i-th node is Ci and there is a value Ai written in that node. Chef calculates the beauty of his tree as ∑Ni=1Ai⋅Fi, where Fi denotes the number of distinct colours of nodes in the subtree of the i-th node (including this node).
Now, Chef is trying to improve the beauty of the tree ― he wants to make Q updates, where in each update, he chooses a node a and an integer x and changes the colour of the node a to x. After each update, find the beauty of the tree. Note that the updates are permanent, i.e. they affect all subsequent updates.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
Each of the following N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting an edge between nodes u and v.
The next line contains N space-separated integers C1,C2,…,CN.
The next line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
Each of the following Q lines contains two space-separated integers a and x describing a query.

Output
For each update, print a single line containing one integer ― the beauty of the tree after this update is performed.
Constraints

1≤T≤2
1≤N,Q≤105
1≤Ai,Ci≤N for each valid i
