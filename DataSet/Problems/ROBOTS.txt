Chefland is a big city which consists of infinite number of junctions on a 2D plane. The junctions are depicted below and they form a hexagonal grid — they satisfy the following conditions:

Two of the junctions have coordinates (0,0)(0,0) and (1,0)(1,0).
Each junction J is connected by line segments with six other junctions. These junctions are the vertices of a regular hexagon with side length 1 and their distances from J are also all equal to 1.


Chef created a robot that can traverse the junctions. Initially, it is in some junction and oriented towards another junction which is connected to it by a line segment. The robot accepts a string of instructions — decimal digits 0 through 5. It executes the instructions one by one and stops after executing the final instruction. When the robot executes an instruction denoted by a digit d, it first rotates by 60⋅d degrees counterclockwise and then moves 1 unit forward, to the junction it is oriented towards.
Chef wants to test the robot, so he wrote a string S of N instructions. You should answer Q queries. In each query, Chef wants to give the robot a substring of instructions SL,SL+1,…,SR; the robot starts in the junction (0,0) and it is oriented towards (1,0). You should find the final position (the x- and y-coordinates) of the robot.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The second line contains a single string S with length N.
Q lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers L and R describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing two space-separated real numbers — the coordinates of the robot. Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error of each coordinate does not exceed 10−6.
Warning: Outputting more than 8 digits after floating point may result in exceeding output size limit and receiving "Runtime error" verdict.
