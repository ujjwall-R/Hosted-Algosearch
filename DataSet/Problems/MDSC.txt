 Chef is a very thrilling person. He always tries risky task. One fine day his friend told him that there is a treasure in an island called Trap of Death. After listening to his friend he immediately start his journey towards the island. He passed all the challenges before him. But the last stage is way more dangerous than he thought. In this stage there is a NNxNN matrix of tiles between treasure and Chef. He needs to step forward very carefully because one wrong step may cause death.If we consider NxN matrix, initially chef is at position (1,1) and treasure is kept at position (N,N) (rows and columns are numbered from 1 to N inclusive). 
 There are two instructions to pass the matrix of tiles. 

 1. Chef can only move down and right in the matrix of tiles.
 	 2. All the tiles are either black or white. Chef can step only upon white tiles. If he step upon black tiles, he will die.For sake of convenience, white and black tiles are denoted by 0 and 1. 
 For example : 


0
0
1
0


1
0
0
1


0
1
0
0

0
0

3. There is number written on every tiles called weight of tiles. Chef needs to step in such a way that at the end of journey the sum of stepped weight of tiles is minimum possible.

In the given example, the possible paths are  (1,1),(1,2),(2,2),(2,3),(3,3),(3,4),(4,4) and (1,1),(1,2),(2,2),(2,3),(3,3),(4,3),(4,4). Sum of weights in first path and second path are 20 and 22. Chef will have to follow the minimum weight sum path, in this case first path will give minimum weight sum.

 Input 

 The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 
 The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of the matrices. 
 First N lines will follow the weights matrix W, Wij denotes the  weight of the ijth tile, where i denotes ith row and j denotes jth column. 
 Another N lines will follow matrix P. Pij element denotes  whether the ijth tile is black or white. "1" denotes black tile and "0" denotes white tile, where i denotes ith row and j denotes jth column. 


  Output 

Output will contain two space separated string "Yes" and integer minimum weighted path sum  if there is a possible path or print "No" if there isn't a path. 


 Constraints 

 1≤T≤100 
 2≤N≤500 
 0≤Wij≤105 
 0≤Pij≤1

 Example output 
 
   No
   Yes 15
  

 Example case 1 : 
There is no white tiles path from position (1,1) to position (N,N). 
 Example case 2 : 
 There is four possible paths - 

 Path 1 : (1,1),(1,2),(2,2),(2,3),(3,3). Weighted sum of path is 21 
 Path 2 : (1,1),(1,2),(2,2),(3,2),(3,3). Weighted sum of path is 15 
 Path 3 : (1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3),(3,3). Weighted sum of path is 22 
 Path 2 : (1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,2),(3,3). Weighted sum of path is 16 

 In this case minimum weighted sum is 15.
