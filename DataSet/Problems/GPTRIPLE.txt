Geometric progressions are cool sequences of numbers. Formally, we define a geometric progression as a series of numbers, with a common ratio k, such that the sequence is of the form b*k0 , b*k1, b*k2,b*k3,b*k4 and so on.    

Alternatively, we can define a Geometric Progression as a sequence of terms in which each succeeding term is obtained by multiplying its preceding term by a constant.


We are given an array of N integers, and the value of K (common ratio). 
 Find the number of triplets that can be formed from the array A,
 such that their common ratio is K. 
 i.e., Find the total number of possible distinct combinations of (i1,i2,i3) such that A[i1] , A[i2] , A[i3] are in GP and  1 ≤ i1 < i2 < i3 ≤ N 
Input
The first line contains N and K, and the second line consists of N integers 
Output
A single number - the number of ways to form a GP triplet of common ratio K 
Constraints
 1 <= N <= 100000 
 1 <= K <= 100000 
 -1000000000 <= A[i] <= 1000000000 
Example 1
Input:
5 2
1 1 2 2 4

Output:
4

 
Explanation
 The possible triplet values are (1,3,5), (1,4,5), (2,3,5), (2,4,5).
 All these combinations produce a subsequence [1,2,4] and this is a GP of common ratio 2.
