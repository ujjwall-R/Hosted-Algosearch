Since Chef was getting bored in his holidays, he was wondering how many subarrays exist in the array, such that the arithmetic mean (avergae) of the subarray is less than the integer K. As the number of such subarrays can be a lot, Chef is asking for your help to exhaust his curiosity. 

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array. A single element is also considered a subarray. For example, [3], [4] and [3, 4, 5] are some of the subarrays of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Two subarrays are different if their start or/and end indices are different. 

 
Input
The first line of each test case contains two integers N and K. The second line contains N space-separated integers in non-decreasing order A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.

Output
Output one integer, the number of subarrays who has mean strictly less than K. Note that this number exceed the maximum of what a C++ integer can hold. 


Subtasks

1 ≤ Ai ≤ 109 for all subtasks

Subtask 1(10 points): All numbers in the array are the same
Subtask 2(30 points): 1 ≤ N ≤ 103, 1 ≤ K ≤ 103
Subtask 3(60 points): 1 ≤ N ≤ 106, 1 ≤ K ≤ 109
 
Example
Input:
5 4
2 2 3 5 6 

Output:
9

 
Explanation
 The subarrays are: [2], [2], [3], [2, 2], [2, 3], [2, 2, 3], [2, 3, 5], [2, 2, 3, 5], [2, 2, 3, 5, 6]
