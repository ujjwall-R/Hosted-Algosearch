A dummy palindromic string (DPS) is a string which can be converted into a palindrome by performing each of the following operations exactly once:

Permute the characters of the string in an arbitrary way.
Choose a valid index ii and change the ii-th character of the resulting string to a different character (not necessarily present in the original string).

You are given a string SS. Find out whether it is a DPS.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single string S.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "DPS" if the string is a DPS or "!DPS" if it is not (without quotes).
Constraints

1≤T≤102
1≤|S|≤104
S contains only lowercase English letters

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (30 points): S contains only the letter 'a'
Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints

4

xyxyxy
sad
baab



                        Sample Output 1

!DPS


Explanation
Example case 1: It is impossible to convert the string "code" into a palindrome by permuting and changing a single character.
Example case 2: We can permute the string to "xyxyyx" and then replace the 3-rd character by 'y'. We obtain the string "xyyyyx", which is a palindrome.
Example case 3: In the first operation, we can leave the string unchanged ("sad"), and then, we can replace its 1-st character by 'd'. We obtain "dad", which is a palindrome.
Example case 4: Even though the string is already a palindrome, it is impossible to obtain a palindrome again by permuting its characters and changing a character.
