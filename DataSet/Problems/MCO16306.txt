Today, Fluffy decided to play with a sequence of integers, a1a1, a2a2, ……, an which is coincidentally a permutation of the numbers 1, 2, …, n. Fluffy thinks that a sequence b1, b2, …, bk is alternating if and only if either of the following holds :

For all i, bi<bi+1 if and only if i is odd
For all i, bi<bi+1 if and only if i is even

For example, 1,4,2,5,3 and 4,1,5,2,3 are both alternating sequences.
A subsequence of a sequence is a sequence that is formed by deleting zero or more elements of the original sequence. For example, 3, 4, 5 is a subsequence of 1, 3, 2, 4, 7, 6, 5. 
Flippy the bird has asked Fluffy to find the longest alternating subsequence of the array a, but there are so many of them, so he also wants to know the number of longest alternating subsequences. Can you help him?
Input

The first line contains a single integer n, the length of the sequence.
The next line contains n space-separated integers, a1, a2, …, an. It is guaranteed that these numbers are a permutation of 1, 2, …, n.

Output
Output two space-separated integers, the length of the longest alternating subsequences and the number of longest alternating subsequences. Since there might be many longest alternating subsequences, output the number of alternating subsequences modulo 109+7
Constraints

1≤n≤3⋅105

Subtasks
Subtask 1 (13 points) : 1≤n≤20
Subtask 2 (23 points) : 1≤n≤5000
Subtask 3 (64 points) : No additional constraints
Example Input
4
2 1 3 4

Example Output
3 2

Explanation
There are 2 longest alternating subsequences, which have length 3. They are 2, 1, 3 and 2, 1, 4.
