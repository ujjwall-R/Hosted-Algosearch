This is an interactive problem.
Sushi has a sequence of integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN; each of them is between 11 and 106106 inclusive. You do not know this sequence, but for a strange reason (maybe because you love her!), you have to find it.
You may ask up to 2,222 queries. In each query:

You should choose two integers K and X (1≤K≤N+1, 1≤X≤106).
Sushi creates a new sequence B1,B2,…,BN+1, where BK=X and if we deleted the element BK from this sequence, we would obtain the sequence A.
Then, Sushi tells you the number of inversions in the sequence B, i.e. the number of pairs (i,j) such that 1≤i<j≤N+1 and Bi>Bj.

Interaction

First, you should read a line containing a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of interaction for T test cases follows.
For each test case, you should start by reading a line containing a single integer N.
To ask a query, you should print a line containing the character '?', followed by a space and two space-separated integers K and X describing your query. Then, you must read a line containing a single integer ― the answer to the query.
When you have guessed the sequence, print a single line containing the character '!', followed by a space and N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN (1≤Ai≤106 for each valid i). This does not count as a query.

If you ask more than 2,222 queries or do not follow the interaction format, you may receive any verdict.
Do not forget to flush the output after printing each line!

Example Input
You             Sushi
                2
                2
? 1 1
                1
? 2 4
                2
? 2 2
                3
? 3 4
                1
! 3 1
                1
? 1 5
                1
? 1 4
                0
! 4

Explanation
Example case 1: The sequence Sushi has is A=[3,1]. Your interaction with Sushi is as follows:

? 1 1: Sushi creates the sequence B=[1,3,1] and returns the number of inversions in it, which is 1.
? 2 4: Sushi creates the sequence B=[3,4,1] and returns the number of inversions in it, which is 2.
? 2 2: Sushi creates the sequence B=[3,2,1] and returns the number of inversions in it, which is 3.
? 3 4: Sushi creates the sequence B=[3,1,4] and returns the number of inversions in it, which is 1.
! 3 1: You have guessed the sequence to be [3,1], which is correct.
