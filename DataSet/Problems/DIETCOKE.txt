A straight, red line has been drawn from one corner to another (left to right).
Find the number of blocks that contains the red line on it.

Input:

1. The first line will input T - the number of testcases.
2. The following T lines will contain M  , N as space separated inputs (M=rows, N=Cols)
Output:
1. Print a single line integer - the  number of tiles that fall in the path of diagonal


Constraints:

 1 <= T <= 100
 0 <= M , N <= 1e18
Example Input:

2
3 3
3 4
Example Output:

3
6

Explanation:
