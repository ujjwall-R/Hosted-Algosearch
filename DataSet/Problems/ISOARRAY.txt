Today, Chef came up with the following problem:

Consider two arrays a and b with the same size. Denote the multisets of all elements of arrays a and b by 
MA and MB respectively.
The arrays a, b are isomorphic if it's possible to find a bijective function f: Z → Z which satisfies the following rules:

Let's construct a new multiset MF. For each element x of MA, we should insert f(x) into MF.
The multisets MF and MB should be identical.


For example, if MA = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3} and MB = {3, 3, 4, 9, 9, 9}, we can choose the function f in the following way: f(1) = 3, f(2) = 9, f(3) = 4. After applying f() on each element of MA, we obtain the multiset {3, 3, 9, 9, 9, 4} = MB. Therefore, a and b are isomorphic.

Now, Chef has an array a with size n; he wants to ask you q queries. For each query, you are given two subarrays ax, ax+1, ..., ay and az, az+1, ..., at (1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ n, 1 ≤ z ≤ t ≤ n, y - x = t - z); you should determine if the subarrays are isomorphic.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n denoting the size of the array a.
The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an.
The next line contains a single integer q denoting the number of queries you must answer.
Each of the following q lines contains four space-separated integers x, z, c, d describing one query. The indices y and t are generated in the following way:

Let k = min(n − x, n − z) + 1.
Let last be equal to the index of the last query for which its answer was "YES" (queries are indexed from 1), or last = 0 if there isn't such query yet.
y = x + (c + d · last) % k
t = z + (c + d · last) % k



Output
For each query, print a single line containing the string "YES" (without quotes) if the two subarrays are isomorphic or "NO" otherwise.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ n ≤ 75000
1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 105
1 ≤ ai ≤ n
1 ≤ x, z ≤ n
0 ≤ c, d ≤ 109
sum of n over all test cases ≤ 150000
sum of q over all test cases ≤ 4 · 105

Explanation
Example case 1:

query 2: last = 1, x = 1, y = 3, z = 2, t = 4
query 3: last = 1, x = 2, y = 2, z = 4, t = 4
query 4: last = 3, x = 3, y = 3, z = 5, t = 5
query 5: last = 4, x = 2, y = 2, z = 5, t = 5
