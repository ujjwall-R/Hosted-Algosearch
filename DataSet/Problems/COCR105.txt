Champak is a bright student who is very fond of clocks. 
He comes across a puzzle which states that he needs to calculate the number of times the minute hand and hour hand of a clock will make a 90o degrees angle between them.
He is given T such queries with time range from L hours to R hours (both inclusive in the 24-hour format) like [L,R].
He has to count the number of times the clock will have a right angle between the hour hand and the minute hand in the given time range.
Input:

First line will contain an integer T, number of queries. Then the queries follow. 
Each query contains of a single line of input, two integers L,R. 

Output:
For each query, output in a single line the number of times the hour hand and the minute hand make a right angle between them from L hours to R hours (both inclusive).
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
0≤L≤R≤24

Sample Input:
6
3 5
0 2
5 8
16 20
7 7
15 21

Sample Output:
4
4
6
8
0
12

EXPLANATION:
For the second query, the hour hand and the minute hand will make right angles between them 4 times, twice between 0 to 1 hours and twice between 1 to 2 hours.
