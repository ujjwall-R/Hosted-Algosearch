The engineers at DuckDuckGo are making a new algorithm which will help their search engine to outperform Google in a lot of areas. But recently they hit a roadblock. After a lot of thinking one of the engineers pointed out that if they can find the number of trailing zeroes in 11! * 22! * 33!* .... NN!.where N is natural number, they would be able to overcome the hurdle they have been facing and continue with designing their algorithm.
Can you help DuckDuckGo overcome this problem and contribute towards the creation of a search engine which may overtake Google at some point

 
Input
The input contains several test cases.The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases
Each test case comprises of a natural numbers  N.

Output
You need to output the number of trailing zeroes in the above expression.The answer must be in MOD 100000007 .
Tips:
Constraints
Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 500

 
Example
Input:
2
2
7

Output:
0
120
