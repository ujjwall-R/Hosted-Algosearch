Chef has started learning to solve dynamic programming problems recently. He has practiced on a lot of problems already, so he wants to try his hands on the hardest problems in this domain.
Chef only likes the interesting part of solving dynamic programming problems — specifically, he just likes to divide a problem into beautiful subproblems which consist of solving recurrences; he finds actually solving these recurrences quite boring. Since you are Chef's assistant, your job is solving this boring part for Chef.
Let's define a recurrent sequence {dp(k)}∞k=1{dp(k)}∞k=1 with parametres AA, BB and KK as follows:

dp(1)=K
for n>1, dp(n)=A⋅dp(n−1)+B⋅n−1∑i=1dp(i)⋅dp(n−i)

Chef would like you to find the sum R∑i=Ldp(i)2. Since this number can be very large, compute it modulo 109+7. He wants to do this for Q pairs of L and R.
Input

The first line of the input contains four space-separated integers N, K, A and B.
The second line of the input contains Q.
The next Q lines contains two space-separated integers L and R.

Output
For every query print a single line containing one integer — the sum R∑i=Ldp(i)2 modulo 109+7.
Constraints

1≤N≤107
1≤Q≤5⋅104
1≤L≤R≤N
1≤B,K≤109+7
0≤A≤109+7

Subtasks

Example Input

4 1 2 1
2
4 4
1 4

Example Output

3249
3403

Explanation
The first four terms of this sequence are:

dp(1)=1
dp(2)=2⋅dp(1)+dp(1)⋅dp(1)=3
dp(3)=2⋅dp(2)+dp(1)⋅dp(2)+dp(2)⋅dp(1)=12
dp(4)=2⋅dp(3)+dp(1)⋅dp(3)+dp(2)⋅dp(2)+dp(3)⋅dp(1)=57

The answers for first and second query are:

(dp(4)⋅dp(4))%(109+7)=3249
(dp(1)⋅dp(1)+dp(2)⋅dp(2)+dp(3)⋅dp(3)+dp(4)⋅dp(4))%(109+7)=3403
