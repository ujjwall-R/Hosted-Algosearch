Dr.D is now fond of matrices. He is particularly interested in Doofish Matrices. A Doofish Matrix of order N is a matrix with N rows (numbered 1 through N) and N columns (numbered 1 through N) such that:

Each element of this matrix is an integer between 1 and 2N−1 inclusive.
For each i and j (1≤i≤N, 1≤j≤2N−1), the integer j appears in the i-th row and/or in the i-th column.

Now, for a given N, Dr.D is wondering if there is a Doofish Matrix of order N. Find such a matrix or determine that it does not exist. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N.

Output
For each test case:

First, print a line containing the string "Hooray" if a Doofish Matrix of order N exists or "Boo" if it does not.
If it exists, print N more lines describing one such matrix. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines should contain N space-separated integers ― the elements in the i-th row.

Constraints

1≤T≤2,000
1≤N≤2,000
the sum of N2 over all test cases does not exceed 4⋅106

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (29 points): N is a power of 2
Subtask #2 (71 points): original constraints
