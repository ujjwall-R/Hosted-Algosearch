Chef wants to set up restaurants between Berhampore and different cities.
Given a distance DD between the city and Berhampore, You need to find the minimum no. of restaurants chef needs to build.
However, distance between two consecutive restaurants should not be more than KK kilometers.
Also, to maximize profit, Chef must set up restaurants on every major cities in between.
Consider Chef already have a restaurant in berhampore. And roads between different cities do not overlap.
Input:

First line contains TT no. of test cases
for every test case, Next line consists of three space separated integers, D , K and N
for every test case, Next line contains N space separated integers containing distances between ith major city and Berhmapore

Output:
For every test case print minimum no. of restaurants he need to set up in new line
Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤D≤3000
1≤K≤100
0≤N≤50
1≤A[i]≤3000

Sample Input:
1
20 5 2
4 17

Sample Output:
5

EXPLANATION:
Chef needs to build restaurants on 4 ( City 1 ), 9, 14, 17 ( City 2 ), 20 ( Destination - Which is a city )
Hence a total of 5 restaurants
