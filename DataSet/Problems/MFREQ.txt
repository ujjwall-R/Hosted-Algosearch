Given an array of size n, you have to answer queries of the form :  L R k . For each query, you have to find an element which occurs consecutively in the subarray [L,R] more than or equal to k times. k will always be greater than floor((R-L+1)/2). If no such element exists, print -1.

Input
First line of the input contains 2 space separated N and M, denoting the size of the array and the number of queries. 
The next line contains N space separated integers, where the i-th integer Ai denotes the ith element of the array.
Each of the next M lines contains 3 integers space separated integers L, R and k.
Output
Output M lines where each line contains the answer to the i-th query.
Constraints
1 ≤ N, M ≤ 105
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N
floor((R-L+1)/2) < k ≤ R-L+1
0 ≤ Ai ≤ 109
