Chef has an array consisting of N+K−1N+K−1 integers. The array contains only the first NN positive odd numbers. Each number appears exactly once, except for one number which appears exactly KK times. The sum of integers in Chef's array is equal to SS.
For example, for N=3, K=2, the possible arrays could be [1,1,3,5], [3,1,3,5], [5,3,5,1]. For N=1, K=3, there is only one possible array: [1,1,1].
Chef gives you three integers N, K and S and asks you to find the only element which appears K times in his array.
It is guaranteed that for the given input, there exists a valid array consisting of N+K−1 elements with a sum exactly equal to S.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N,K,S.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing the integer which appeared K times in Chef's array.
