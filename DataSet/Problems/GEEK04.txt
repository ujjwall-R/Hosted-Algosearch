Problem Statement
We have N people standing of one side of river and only one boat to cross the river. The rowing time of all the persons is given. A boat can accomodate maximum 2 people at a time and the time of rowing is same is the time of rowing of slower person. Find the minimum total time in which all persons can cross the river.
Note that people whose rowing time is less are given by larger integers.
Input section
The first line contains, T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contains 2 lines each. The first line has an integer N, denoting the number of persons. Next line contains N space separated distinct integers denoting the rowing time of people.
Output section
For each test case, print the minimum time required to cross the people.
Input constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 20
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 100000, A[i] is the array of rowing time

Subtasks

Subtask #1 (10 points) : 1 ≤ T ≤ 10, 1 ≤ N ≤ 3
Subtask #2 (20 points) : 1 ≤ T ≤ 5, 1 ≤ N ≤ 8
Subtask #3 (30 points) : 1 ≤ T ≤ 5, 1 ≤ N ≤ 10
Subtask #4 (40 points) : 1 ≤ T ≤ 3, 1 ≤ N ≤ 20

Sample Input
3
2
200 100
3
100 200 300
4
623 821 145 720

Sample Output
200
600
2454


For the second test case, the required moves are : 

Send person 1 and 2 in the boat. The rowing time will be 200.
Let the person 1 come back. The rowing time will be 100.
Send the person 1 and 3 in the boat. The rowing time will be 300.


Hence the total time taken is (200 + 100 + 300) = 600
