WARNING: This problem has large input / output files. Use of faster I/O methods is recommended.
Chef has a sequence of N positive integers { a1, a2, a3, ... aN }. The Sous Chef wants to choose another sequence of N non-negative integers { b1, b2, b3, ... bN } such that

The bitwise xor sum of these 2 sequences is equal
i.e, a1 ^ a2 ^ a3 ^ ... aN = b1 ^ b2 ^ b3 ^ ... bN
for each i, bi ≤ ai


The Sous Chef asks for your help. Your allegiance to the Chef withstanding, you tell him that you will not generate such a sequence for him. Instead, you will tell him the number of such sequences possible.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the length of your sequence. The second line contains N space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., aN. 
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the number of ways your friend can choose his sequence. Since this number may be too big, output this number modulo 1000000009.
Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000000000

Explanation
Test Case 1: The only possible sequence is { 5 }.
Test Case 2: There are 4 possible sequences whose bitwise xor is equal to 3^3 = 0


{ 0, 0 }
{ 1, 1 }
{ 2, 2 }
{ 3, 3 }


Test Case 4: The 6 possible sequences are


{ 0, 0, 0, 4 }
{ 0, 1, 1, 4 }
{ 1, 0, 1, 4 }
{ 1, 1, 0, 4 }
{ 0, 2, 2, 4 }
{ 1, 2, 3, 4 }
