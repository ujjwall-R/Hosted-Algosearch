You are given a sequence of positive integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. You must choose three elements Ax,Ay,AzAx,Ay,Az (xx, y, z should be pairwise distinct) such that there is a non-degenerate triangle XYZ with the following properties:

|XY|=Az, |XZ|=Ay, |YZ|=Ax
the angle |∠YXZ|=θ satisfies cosθ≥P/Q

In addition, the angle θ should be maximum possible. Find any such triangle or determine that it does not exist.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, P and Q.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
If there is no solution, print a single line containing one integer −1. Otherwise, print a single line containing three space-separated integers x, y and z.
If there are multiple possible solutions, you may output any one.
Constraints
