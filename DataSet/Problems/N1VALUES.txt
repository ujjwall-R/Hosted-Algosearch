You are given a positive integer NN. You have to print exactly N+1N+1 positive integers 
satisfying the following conditions:

Exactly one value should appear twice, all the remaining values should appear only once.
Sum of all these values should be equal to 2N2N.

You have to print the values in non-decreasing order. If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing N+1 positive integers in non-decreasing order that satisfy the given conditions. If there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them.

Explanation
Test Case 1: 2 is repeated twice and the remaining elements occurred only once and the sum of all the elements is equal to 8, which is 23.
Test Case 2: 3 is repeated twice and the remaining elements occurred only once and the sum of all the elements is equal to 16, which is 24.
