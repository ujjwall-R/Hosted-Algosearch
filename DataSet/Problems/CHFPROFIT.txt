Explanation
Test Case 1: Chef bought X=2 stocks for Y=5 each, making the total amount spent by Chef =2⋅5=10.
Chef can sell this stock today for Z=20, making the total amount received by Chef =2⋅20=40.
The total profit is then the amount received minus the amount spent, which equals 40−10=30.
Test Case 2: Chef bought X=3 stocks for Y=1 each, making the total amount spent by Chef =3⋅1=3.
Chef can sell this stock today for Z=2, making the total amount received by Chef =3⋅2=6.
The total profit is then the amount received minus the amount spent, which equals 6−3=3.
Test Case 3: Chef bought X=4 stocks for Y=5 each, making the total amount spent by Chef =4⋅5=20.
Chef can sell this stock today for Z=6, making the total amount received by Chef =4⋅6=24.
The total profit is then the amount received minus the amount spent, which equals 24−20=4
