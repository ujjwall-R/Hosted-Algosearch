Problem description.
You are given a convex polygon of n vertices P1, P2, ..., Pn (in counter-clock or clock order). Each vertex is assigned with a weight wi.
Find a subset of vertices that includes vertex 1.
1 = i1 < i2 < ... < ik ≤
 n that maximizes ratio:
(dist(i1, i2) + dist(i2, i3) + ... + dist(ik, i1)) / (wi1 + wi2 + ... + wik).
Where dist(i, j) refers to Euclidean distance between two points Pi, Pj.
 
Input
The first line contains an integer T denotes the number of test cases. Each test case is describes as follow: 
An integer n on a single line.
n next lines, each line contains two integers, that is coordinates of i-th vertex
The last line contains n space-seperated integer, denotes weight of vertex.
 
Output
Each testcase output the maximum ratio can reach on a single line.
Your answer will be considered correct if it has an absolute error less then 10-6.
