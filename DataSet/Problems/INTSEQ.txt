You are given an integer $K$.
Consider an integer sequence $A = [A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N]$.
Define another sequence $S$ of length $N$, such that $S_i = A_1 + A_2 + \ldots + A_i$ for each $1 \leq i \leq N$.
$A$ is said to be interesting if $A_i + S_i = K$ for every $1 \leq i \leq N$.
Find the maximum length of an interesting sequence. If there are no interesting sequences, print $0$.
Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, which contains a single integer $K$.

Output Format

For each test case, print a new line containing one integer — the maximum length of an interesting sequence for a given value of $K$.

Constraints

$1 \leq T \leq 5000$
$1 \leq K \leq 10^9$

Explanation
Test Case $1$: Consider the sequence $A = [4, 2, 1]$. $S = [4, 4 + 2, 4 + 2 + 1] = [4, 6, 7]$. 
The sum of the corresponding elements of $A$ and $S$ are $4 + 4 = 8$, $2 + 6 = 8$ and $1 + 7 = 8$. Thus $A$ is an interesting sequence of size $3$.  
Test Case $2$: Consider the sequence $A = [2, 1]$. $S = [2, 2 + 1] = [2, 3]$. 
The sum of the corresponding elements of $A$ and $S$ are $2 + 2 = 4$ and $1 + 3 = 4$. Thus $A$ is an interesting sequence of size $2$.
It's guaranteed that, in both examples above, there doesn't exist a longer sequence satisfying the problem constraints.
