                        Sample Input 1
                        





100 20



                        Sample Output 1
                        





90


Explanation
For the first Y=20 minutes, Chef watches at twice the usual speed, so the total amount of time spent to watch this portion of the movie is Y2=10 minutes.
For the remaining X−Y=80 minutes, Chef watches at the usual speed, so it takes him 80 minutes to watch the remaining portion of the movie.
In total, Chef spends 10+80=90 minutes watching the entire movie.

                        Sample Input 2
                        





50 24



                        Sample Output 2
                        





38


Explanation
For the first Y=24 minutes, Chef watches at twice the usual speed, so the total amount of time spent to watch this portion of the movie is Y2=12 minutes.
For the remaining X−Y=26 minutes, Chef watches at the usual speed, so it takes him 26 minutes to watch the remaining portion of the movie.
In total, Chef spends 12+26=38 minutes watching the entire movie.
