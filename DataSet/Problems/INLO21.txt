 
The engineers at Google love to come up with different games which stretch the mind and make you think hard. The other day while playing chess, one of the engineers challenged his opponent to tell him the number of rectangles that are contained in the chessboard.
Being Google, the chessboards they have here are not necessarily of the standard 8x8 size. Rather they can be of any arbitrary size M x N (M,N are natural numbers).

 
Input
The input contains several test cases.The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case comprises of 2 natural numbers, M & N, which denotes the size of the grid.

Output
For each test case you are required to output the total number of rectangles contained in the grid .Answer must be in MOD 1000000007 .
 
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ <1000
1 ≤ m ≤ <100000
1 ≤ n ≤ <100000

 
Example
Input:
