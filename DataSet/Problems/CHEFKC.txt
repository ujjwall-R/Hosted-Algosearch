Chef likes Graphs Theory a lot. Recently he learned about minimum cut. During his assignments, he found a problem which he couldn't solve. Can you please help him in solving the problem?


You are given an oriented weighted graph G with two chosen nodes s and t. Let's order all distinct cuts between s and t cuts between s and t by weight. You have to find the weight of k-th minimum cut. Two cuts (U1, V1) and (U2, V2) are said to be distinct if the U1 != U2 or V1 != V2. In total, there will be total 2^(n-2) such cuts. 

Input
There is a single test case.
First line of the input contains three positive integers - N (number nodes of the graph) and M (number of edges)  and k 
Second line of the input contains two integers - s and t 
Next M lines contain information about edges 
First two integers of each of the next M lines denoting nodes connected by edge, third integer denoting weight of this edge c.  
Output
Output a single integer in a line - weight of k-th minimum cut of graph G

Constraints

2 ≤ N ≤ 77
2 ≤ M ≤ 777
2 ≤ k ≤ 777
1 ≤ s, t ≤ N
1 ≤ c ≤ 106
It is guaranteed that K won't exceed number of distinct cuts, i.e. 1 ≤ K ≤ 2(n-2)

Subtasks
