You are given a string ss, of length nn. You have to output all the sub-sequences of ss, with length exactly equal to n, in increasing order, each in a new line.
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
For ex.: abc is a sub-sequence of abdc, while acb is not.
Input:

First line will contain n, the length of the string.
Second line will contain the string s.

Output:
For the given string s, print all the sub-sequences of s, with length exactly equal to n.
Constraints:

1≤n≤106
s only contains Lower-Case English Alphabets.

Sample Input:
3
hey

Sample Output:
hey
