Chef has a number D containing only digits 0's and 1's. He wants to make the number to have all the digits same. For that, he will change exactly one digit, i.e. from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. If it is possible to make all digits equal (either all 0's or all 1's) by flipping exactly 1 digit then output "Yes", else print "No" (quotes for clarity)
Input
 The first line will contain an integer T representing the number of test cases.
Each test case contain a number made of only digits 1's and 0's on newline
Output
 Print T lines with a "Yes" or a "No", depending on whether its possible to make it all 0s or 1s or not. 
Constraints
Subtask #1: (40 points)

1 ≤ T ≤ 50
1 ≤ Length of the number D ≤ 50
 
Subtask #2: (60 points)

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ Length of the number D ≤ 105


                        Sample Input 1
                        





2
101

Yes
No


Explanation
Example case 1. In 101, the 0 can be flipped to make it all 1..
Example case 2. No matter whichever digit you flip, you will not get the desired string.
