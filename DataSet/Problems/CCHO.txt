Everyone is busy buying colours and water guns for HOLI. Chef being  small,  can’t buy colours or guns on his own. So, his elder sister Chefina was given the task of buying those colours and other stuff and distribute them between Chef and herself. But Chefina proved to be a mischiveous.
She wants an answer from Chef and in return she will give Chef his part of the colours and water guns provided Chef gives the correct answer.
The question Chefina asks Chef is in the form of a string of digits which is manipulated as follow: 
In the chosen string Chefina changed perfect square digits 44 and 99 with the square root of these numbers written twicetwice simultaneously instead of them. For example if string is ‘14′ then chefina gives ‘122′ to chef.
So Chef’s work is to count thepossible number of strings that Chefina might have used to make up the manipulated string in the question.
But since Chef is a small child he gives this work to you and asks for your help. Your task is to help Chef get his share of colours.
Also since this number can be quite large, tell Chef instead its remainder when divided by 109+7.
Print 0 if chefina gave a faulty manipulated string of digits.

Input:
First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, a string S consisting of digits from 1 to 9. 

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line answer i.e. count of the number of strings that Chefina might have used to make up the manipulated string in the question.

Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤|S|≤105

Subtasks
Subtask #1(20 points): 1≤T≤10, 1≤|S|≤20
Subtask #2(30 points): 1≤T≤50, 1≤|S|≤103
Subtask #3(50 points): Original Constraints

Sample Input:
3
12215678133
121315
1456688

Sample Output:
4
1
0

EXPLANATION:
For the first case, the chosen strings of digits could be:- "12215678133", "1221567819", "1415678133", and "141567819". 
For the second case, there is only one:- "121315" because no two consecutive 2s or 3s are there in the initial string.
For the last case, there will be no such strings which Chefina could have chose to make a manipulated string like:  "1456688", since the resulting string will not have 4 in it after manipulating it.
