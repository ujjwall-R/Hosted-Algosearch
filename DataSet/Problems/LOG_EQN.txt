Chef has a sequence of N integers A1,A2,...,AN. 
Chef thinks that a triplet of integers (i,j,k) is good if 1≤i<j<k≤N and P in the following expression contains an odd number of ones in its binary representation:
P=[Ai<<(⌊log2(Aj)⌋+⌊log2(Ak)⌋+2)]+[Aj<<(⌊log2(Ak)⌋+1)]+Ak
The << operator is called left shift, x<<y  is defined as x⋅2y.
Help the Chef finding the total number of good triplets modulo 109+7.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N. 
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,...,AN.

Output:
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer, the number of good triplets modulo 109+7.
Constraints:

1≤T≤103
1≤N≤105
1≤Ai≤109
The sum of N over all testcases is less than 106

Sample Input:
1
4
1 1 2 3

Sample Output:
1
