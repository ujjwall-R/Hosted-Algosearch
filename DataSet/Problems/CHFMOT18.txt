In a country called Chef Land, there was a lot of monetary fraud, so Chefu, the head of the country, decided to choose new denominations of the local currency ― all even-valued coins up to an integer NN should exist. After a few days, a citizen complained that there was no way to create an odd value, so Chefu decided that he should also introduce coins with value 11. Formally, you are given an integer NN; for v=1 and each even positive integer v≤N, coins with value v exist.
You are also given an integer S. To handle transactions quickly, find the minimum number of coins needed to pay a price S.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers S and N.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum number of coins.
Constraints

Explanation
Example case 1: One coin with value 2 is sufficient.
Example case 2: We need to use one coin with value 1.
Example case 3: We need 3 coins, each with value 10.
Example case 4: We can use seven coins with value 4, one coin with value 2 and one coin with value 1.
