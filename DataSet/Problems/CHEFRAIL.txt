Chef was working on building rail tracks connecting pairs of railway stations in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system. There are NN stations on the xx-axis, with coordinates x1,x2,…,xNx1,x2,…,xN, and M stations on the y-axis, with coordinates y1,y2,…,yM. Chef has completed his task and built a rail track (line segment) between each pair of stations.
Now, Chef is wondering how many right triangles have the following property: the vertices are stations and the sides are railway tracks between them. Since Chef is busy with his other projects, help him answer this question.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.
The second line contains N space-separated integers x1,x2,…,xN.
The third line contains M space-separated integers y1,y2,…,yM.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of right triangles.

Explanation
Example case 1: There are no triplets where two stations lie on the x-axis and one triplet where two stations lie on the y-axis, which is ((0,2),(0,−8),(−4,0)).
