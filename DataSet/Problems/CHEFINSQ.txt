Chef has a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. This sequence has exactly 2N2N subsequences. Chef considers a subsequence of AA interesting if its size is exactly K and the sum of all its elements is minimum possible, i.e. there is no subsequence with size K which has a smaller sum.
Help Chef find the number of interesting subsequences of the sequence A.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of interesting subsequences.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤K≤N≤50
1≤Ai≤100 for each valid i

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (30 points): 1≤N≤20
Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints

Explanation
Example case 1: There are six subsequences with length 2: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4) and (3,4). The minimum sum is 3 and the only subsequence with this sum is (1,2).
