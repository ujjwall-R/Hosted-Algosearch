NASA went for a space mission to conquer a planet filled with aliens.We can only invade that planet if we break more than 109109 alien building else humans loose.There are AA alien stations numbered from 1 to 10181018 i.e, Ai=i. If Pi denotes power of ith building, then 
                                       Pi=⌈2Ai+MK⌉                                               
Where ⌈n⌉ denotes ceiling of number n and  M,K are integer constants.
The human gun power is X which means it can break alien buildings whose power are less than or equal to X. Find whether the humans win or loose and also find maximum number of houses humans can break.
Input:

First line will contain T, denoting number of test cases. Then the T lines follow.
First line of each test case will contain three integers M,K and X

Output:

Print "YES" if human wins otherwise print "NO" without quotes in a single line and
in next line print maximum no of houses human can break. 

Constraints

1≤T≤100000 
 1≤M,K,X≤1012 

Example Input:
1
2 5 100

Example Output:
NO
249
