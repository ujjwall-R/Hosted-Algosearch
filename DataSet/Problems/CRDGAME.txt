Chef is playing a card game with his friend Morty Smith. 
The rules of the game are as follows:

There are two piles of cards, pile AA and pile BB, each with NN cards in it. Pile AA belongs to Chef and pile BB belongs to Morty.
Each card has one positive integer on it
The ‘power’ of a card is defined as the sum of digits of the integer on that card
The game consists of NN rounds
In each round, both players simultaneously draw one card each from the top of their piles and the player who draws the card with higher power wins this round and gets a point. If the powers of both players' cards are equal then they get 11 point each. 
The winner of the game is the player who has more points at the end of NN rounds. If both players have equal number of points then the game ends in a draw.

The game is now over and Chef has told Morty to find the winner. Unfortunately, this task is too complex for him. Help Morty find the winner. 
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases.
The first line of each test case will contain NN, the number of rounds played.
The ithith of the next NN lines of each test case will contain AiAi and BiBi, the number on the card drawn by Chef and Morty respectively in round ii.

Output:
For each test case, output two space separated integers on a new line:
Output      

00 if Chef wins,             
11 if Morty wins,     
22 if it is a draw,
followed by the number of points the winner had.
(If it is a draw then output either player’s points).

Explanation
Test Case 11:
Round 11: 
Chef’s card has power 1+01+0 = 11,
Morty’s card has power 44.
Therefore, Morty wins the round.        
Round 22: 
Chef’s card has power 88,
Morty’s card has power 1+21+2 = 33.
Therefore, Chef wins the round.     
Round 33: 
Chef’s card has power 77,
Morty’s card has power 66.
Therefore, Chef wins the round.         
Therefore, Chef wins the game with 22 points (Morty has 11 point).  
Test Case 22:
Round 11: 
Chef’s card has power 55,
Morty’s card has power 1+0=11+0=1.
Therefore, Chef wins the round.        
Round 22: 
Chef’s card has power 33,
Morty’s card has power 44.
Therefore, Morty wins the round.     
Therefore, the game ends in a draw and both players have 11 point each.
