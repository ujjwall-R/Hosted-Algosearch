Consider the following task:

You are given N non-empty strings s1,s2,…,sN. These strings are not necessarily distinct.
Let L be the list of all strings formed by concatenating two of the given strings. More formally, start with an empty list and for each valid ordered pair (i,j) such that i≠j, add the string si+sj (+ denotes string concatenation) to this list. There may be multiple copies of any string in L.
L contains exactly N⋅(N−1) strings. Print these strings in an arbitrary order.

This problem is too easy, so you would like to solve the reverse problem: You are given N⋅(N−1) strings l1,l2,…,lN(N−1). Determine if these strings form a possible output for the above problem with some input sequence s1,s2,…,sN and if they do, find one such input sequence.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N.
N⋅(N−1) lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤N⋅(N−1)), the i-th of these lines contains a single string li.

Ouptut
If there is no solution, print a single line containing the string "No" (without quotes).
Otherwise, print N+1 lines. The first of these lines should contain the string "Yes" (without quotes). For each i (1≤i≤N), the i-th of the following N lines should contain a single string si. If there are multiple possible solutions, you may print any one.
Constraints

2≤N≤50
2≤|li|≤104 for each valid i
∑N(N−1)i=1|li|≤2⋅104
each string contains only lowercase English letters
