You are given a convex polygon consisting of n vertices in 2-D plane. You are also given m points, each colored in either red or blue.
A convex polygon is called w00t, if the number of red and blue colored points inside this (inside or on the boundary) are equal.
You want to find number of w00t convex polygons whose vertices are a subset of the vertices of the given convex polygon.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of the test cases.
The first line of each test case will contain two space separated integers n, m denoting the number of points on the convex polygon, and number of the colored points, respectively.
In the next n lines, each line contains two space separated integers x, y denoting the x and y coordinates of the points of convex polygon. The points of the convex polygon are given to you in anticlockwise order. It is guaranteed that no three points on the convex polygon are collinear.
In the next m lines, each line contains three space separated integers x, y, c, where x, y denotes the x and y coordinates of the colored points, and c denotes the color of the point. If c = 0, the point is red colored, where if c = 1, point is blue colored..
Output
For each test case, output a single integer corresponding to the number of w00t convex polygons whose vertices are subset of the given convex polygon.
Constraints 

1 ≤ T ≤ 20
1 ≤ n, m ≤ 50
n ≥ 3
-106 ≤ |xi, yi| ≤ -106
In the given m points, two or more points might coincide.
