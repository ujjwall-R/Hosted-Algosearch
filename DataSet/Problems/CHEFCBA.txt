Chef recently learned about ratios and proportions. He wrote some positive integers a, b, c, d on a paper. Chef wants to know whether he can shuffle these numbers so as to make some proportion? Formally, four numbers x, y, z, w are said to make a proportion if ratio of x : y is same as that of z : w.
Input
Only line of the input contains four space separated positive integers - a, b, c, d.
Output
Print "Possible" if it is possible to shuffle a, b, c, d to make proportion, otherwise "Impossible" (without quotes).
Constraints

1 ≤ a, b, c, d  ≤ 1000


                        Sample Input 1
                        





1 2 4 2



                        Sample Output 1
                        





Possible


Explanation
By swapping 4 and the second 2, we get 1 2 2 4. Note that 1 2 2 4 make proportion as 1 : 2 = 2 : 4. Hence answer is "Possible"
