 
Arya's birthday is here and he has received many gifts. He has received a total of N gifts from his N friends. Each of these friends has gifted him with K numbers.


Now, for each of these gifts he received, Arya has calculated the XOR of all the numbers in the i-th gift.

Furthermore, he found the bitwise AND, S of all these XOR values.
Since he hates being the center of attention in a party, he has decided to minimize the value of S. However, so as not to seem rude, he can only toggle at most one bit at any position of a number in any gift that he recieved.

Since, Arya is busy managing his guests, he needs your help to find the minimum value of S.

 
Input
The first lint contains T,the number of test cases.
The first line of each test cases contains two space separated integers, N and K.
The subsequent N lines contain K space separated integers G[i] denoting each number gifted by that friend.


 
Output
Print T lines, where each line contains the answer to the corresponding test case.

Constraints
1 ≤ T≤ 1000 
1 ≤ N,K≤ 1000 
1 ≤ G[i]≤ (2^10)-1
 
Example
Input:

1
2 2
1 2
3 4


Output:

1

 
Explanation
Example case 1.

XOR of all values in the first row: 3

XOR of all values in the second row: 7


On toggling the 2nd (from the right) bit of the first gift of the first friend, the minimum answer is received.


XOR of all values in the first row: 1

XOR of all values in the second row: 7


1 AND 7 = 1.
