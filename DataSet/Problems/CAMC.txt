Chef placed N boxes (numbered 1 through N) in a straight line. For each valid i, the i-th box contains Ai balls. 
Then, Chef painted the boxes using M distinct colours in such a way that for each M consecutive boxes, no two of these boxes have the same colour.
Help Chef choose M distinct boxes (not necessarily consecutive) such that no two of the chosen boxes have the same colour and the difference between the number of balls in a box that contains the maximum number of balls and a box that contains the minimum number of balls among the chosen boxes is the smallest possible.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum possible difference between the maximum and minimum number of balls in the chosen boxes.
Constraints

2≤M≤N≤105
1≤Ai≤109, for each valid i

Explanation
Example case 1: Let's denote the colours by 'R' (red) and 'G' (green). There are two possible ways of painting the boxes: "RGRG" and  "GRGR".
There are four ways to choose two boxes (one red and one green box). The numbers of balls in them and the differences are:

(10,28) with difference 28−10=18
(10,20) with difference 20−10=10
(15,28) with difference 28−15=13
(15,20) with difference 20−15=5, which is the smallest possible
