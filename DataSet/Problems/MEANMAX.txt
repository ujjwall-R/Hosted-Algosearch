JJ loves playing with averages. He has an array A of length N. He wants to divide the array A into two non-empty subsets P and Q such that the value of mean(P)+mean(Q) is as large as possible. (Note that each Ai must belong to either subset P or subset Q).
Help him find this maximum value of mean(P)+mean(Q).
As a reminder, the mean of a subset X of size M is defined as: mean(X)=∑Mi=1XiM. 
For example, mean([3,1,4,5])=3+1+4+54=3.25.
Input Format

The first line contains T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the size of the array A.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN denoting the array A.

Output Format
Output the largest value of mean(P)+mean(Q).
Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10−6.
Formally, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is accepted if and only if |a−b|max(1,|b|)≤10−6.

Explanation
Test case-1: We can divide the two elements into two non-empty subsets P and Q as follows: P = [4], Q = [5]. 
Therefore, mean(P) + mean(Q) = 9.
Test case-2: In whatever way we divide the elements of the array, mean of both the subsets will always be 2.
Therefore, mean(P) + mean(Q) = 4.
