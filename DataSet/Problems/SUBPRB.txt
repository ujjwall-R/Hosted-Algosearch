Given a positive integer NN, find an array A=[A1,A2,…,AN] of length N consisting of distinct integers from 1 to 109, such that the following condition is satisfied for each subarray [AL,AL+1,…,Ar] (1≤L≤R≤N):

The sum of elements in the subarray is divisible by its length i.e. AL+AL+1+…+AR is divisible by R−L+1.

It can be proved that such an array always exists under given constraints.
If there are multiple possible arrays, you may print any of them.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line containing one positive integer N, the length of the array A.

Output Format
For each test case, print one line containing N space-separated integers, the contents of the array A.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤N≤1000
Sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 5000
