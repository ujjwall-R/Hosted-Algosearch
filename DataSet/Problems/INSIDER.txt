You are given an array AA with NN positive integers.
An xx-insider of this array is a subsequence of A such that x is strictly in between any two consecutive elements of the subsequence. 
More formally, a subsequence S=[s0,s1,…sk−1] of the array A is an x-insider if for every integer i such that 1≤i≤k−1, either

si−1<x<si or
si−1>x>si

For example, for the array [1,4,2,4], the subsequence [1,4,2] is a 3-insider because 1<3<4 and 4>3>2. The subsequence [1,2] is not an x-insider for any integer x. The subsequence [1,4] is a 2-insider as well as a 3-insider. 
Let mk be the smallest integer such that A contains an mk-insider of length exactly k. If such an integer does not exist then mk=−1.
Similarly, let Mk be the largest integer such that A contains an Mk-insider of length exactly k. If such an integer does not exist then Mk=−1.
Find m2,m3,…mN and M2,M3,…MN.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer T, the number of testcases. The description of the T testcases follows.
Each testcase consists of two lines.
The first line contains a single integer, N, the size of the array A.
The second line contains N space-separated integers, A1,A2,…AN, the elements of the array A.

Output Format

For each testcase print two lines.
In the first line print N−1 space separated integers, the values of m2,m3,…mN respectively.
In the second line print N−1 space separated integers, the values of M2,M3,…MN respectively.

Constraints

1≤T≤105
2≤N≤105
sum of N over all testcases ≤2⋅105
1≤Ai≤109 for all valid i

Explanation
Test Case 1: The given array is [1,2,4,1,5]. 
Insiders of length 2: The only subsequences of length 2 that are x-insiders for integer values of x are [1,4],[1,5],[4,1],[2,4],[2,5]. The subsequences [1,4],[1,5],[4,1] are 2-insiders. All of them are 3-insiders. The subsequences [1,5] and [2,5] are 4-insiders. Thus m2=2 and M2=4.
Insiders of length 3: The subsequences of length 3 that are x-insiders for some integer x are [1,4,1], [2,4,1], and [4,1,5]. [1,4,1] is both a 2-insider and a 3-insider; [2,4,1] is only a 3-insider; and [4,1,5] is both a 2-insider and a 3-insider. Thus m3=2 and M3=3.
Insiders of length 4: The subsequences of length 4 that are x-insiders for some integer x are [1,4,1,5] and [2,4,1,5]. [1,4,1,5] is both a 2-insider and a 3-insider ; and [2,4,1,5] is a 3-insider. Thus m4=2 and M4=3.
Insiders of length 5: The only subsequence of length 5 is the array A itself, which is not an x-insider for any integer value of x. Thus m5=M5=−1.
Hence the answers for this testcase are m=[2,2,2,−1] and M=[4,3,3,−1].
Test Case 2: The given array is [1,1,1]. Since all elements are equal, none of the subsequences of this array are x-insiders (for any integer x). Hence the answers are m=[−1,−1] and M=[−1,−1].
Test Case 3: The only subsequence (of length at least 2) that is an x-insider (for integer values of x) is [3,1] which is a 2−insider. Hence the answers are m=[2,−1] and M=[2,−1].
