There are n piles of coins, where the ith pile has ai coins. You need to collect the maximum number of coins from these piles, but you must fulfill the following condition: 
Let's say you pick xi coins from the ith pile, then:

x1+x3+x5… = x2+x4+x6
0≤xi≤ai

For example, if n=3 and, a=[2,3,2], you can pick the coins as x= [1,2,1] becuase x1+x3=1+1=2 and x2=2
Find the maximum total number of coins you can pick.
Input:

The first line of input contains a single integer n denoting the number of piles.
The second line of input contains n space-separated integers ai, where the ith integer denoted the number of coins in ith pile.

Output:
Print a single integer denoting the maximum total number of coins you can pick.
Constraints

2≤n≤105
1≤ai≤103

Sample Input:
4
5 1 1 4

Sample Output:
10

Explanation:
Let x=[4,1,1,4] hence x1+x3=x2+x4 and total number of coins picked is 10. It can be checked that it is not possible to pick any greater number of coins.
