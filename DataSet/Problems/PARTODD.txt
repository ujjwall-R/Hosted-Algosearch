You are given a string AA of length NN, consisting of zeroes and ones. You want to partition it into blocks consisting of consecutive indices such that each block has an odd sum and has length at most mm. For each m from 1 to N, find the minimum number of blocks required, or report that it is impossible.
Input

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case contains two lines:
The first line of each test case contains an integer N.
The second line of each test case contains a string A=a1a2…aN. 

Output
For each test case, print N space-separated integers. The m-th of these integers should be the minimum number of blocks of length at most m the array can be partitioned into, such that each block has an odd sum, or −1 if it is impossible to do so.
Constraints

1≤N≤106
The sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 106.

Subtasks

Subtask 1 (9 Points): The sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 200.
Subtask 2 (13 Points): The sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 2500.
Subtask 3 (21 Points): The sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 15000.
Subtask 4 (17 Points): The sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 50000.
Subtask 5 (24 Points): The sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 250000.
Subtask 6 (16 Points): No additional constraints.

-1 3 3 3 1


Explanation
Clearly if m=1, no such partitioning is possible, as the first block must consist of a single 0.
For m=2,3,4, we can partition it as 01101. Note that 01101 is also a valid partition.
If m=5, the partition consisting of a single block 01101 is valid as the total sum (3) is odd.
