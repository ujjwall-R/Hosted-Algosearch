Chef's friend Igzi is often at the coding gym, working out his mind muscles. When he is there, he asks Chef to guard his most prized posession: a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. Initially, for each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), Ai=i held. However, Chef sometimes gets bored and starts playing with the sequence. Since N can be very large, Chef has a lot of fun with it and he would like to share it with you.
You should process Q queries of two types:

1 x: set Ax=0
2 l r: find the maximum element in the subsequence Al,Al+1,…,Ar

Since Chef does not want to make Igzi angry, the queries are encoded so that they have to be processed online:

For each query, let's denote the sum of answers to all previous queries of type 2, modulo N, by s. (Initially, s=0.)
For each query of the first type, you are given an integer y. You can compute x as y+s.
For each query of the second type, you are given two integers p and q. You can compute l as p+s and r as q+s.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The following Q lines describe queries.
Each of these lines starts with an integer t denoting the type of the current query: t=1 for a query of the first type or t=2 for a query of the second type.
For a query of the first type, it is followed by a space and an integer y.
For a query of the second type, it is followed by a space and two space-separated integers p and q.

Output
For each query of the second type, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum of the given subsequence.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤N≤1018
1≤Q≤500,000
1≤l≤r≤N
1≤x≤N
the sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 1,000,000

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (10 points): N,Q≤1,000
Subtask #2 (10 points): N≤100,000
Subtask #3 (30 points): each query of the second type appears after all queries of the first type
Subtask #4 (50 points): original constraints

Explanation

Query 1: l=2, r=5. The maximum element of the subsequence A2,A3,A4,A5 is A5=5. After this query, s becomes 5%7=5.
Query 2: x=5. A5 becomes 0.
Query 3: l=2, r=5. The maximum element of the same subsequence is now A4=4; s becomes (5+4)%7=2.
Query 4: x=3, A3 becomes 0.
Query 5: l=2, r=5. The maximum element of the same subsequence is still A4=4; s becomes (5+4+4)%7=6.
Query 6: x=2, A2 becomes 0.
Query 7: x=4, A4 becomes 0.
Query 8: l=2, r=5. All elements of the same subsequence as before are 0, so the maximum is 0; s becomes (5+4+4+0)%7=6.
Query 9: l=1, r=3. The maximum of the subsequence A1,A2,A3 is A1=1; s becomes (5+4+4+0+1)%7=0.
