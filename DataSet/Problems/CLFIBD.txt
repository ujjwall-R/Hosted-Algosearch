For a string SS let the unique set of characters that occur in it one or more times be CC. Consider a permutation of the elements of CC as (c1,c2,c3...). Let f(c) be the number of times c occurs in S.
If any such permutation of the elements of C satisfies f(ci)=f(ci−1)+f(ci−2) for all i≥3, the string is said to be a dynamic string.
Mr Bancroft is given the task to check if the string is dynamic, but he is busy playing with sandpaper. Would you help him in such a state?
Note that if the number of distinct characters in the string is less than 3, i.e. if |C|<3, then the string is always dynamic.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, a string S.

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line "Dynamic" if the given string is dynamic, otherwise print "Not". (Note that the judge is case sensitive)
Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤|S|≤105
S contains only lower case alphabets: a, b, …, z

Explanation

Testase 1: For the given string, C={a,b,c} and f(a)=4,f(b)=1,f(c)=3. f(a)=f(c)+f(b) so the permutation (b,c,a) satisfies the requirement.
Testcase 2: Here too C={a,b,c} but no permutation satisfies the requirement of a dynamic string.
Testcase 3: Here C={m,n,o,p} and (m,n,o,p) is a permutation that makes it a dynamic string.
