 
A cab owner have N number of cars all are running in city. He give a problem to his one employee.
Cab owner want to check whether a user can book a car or not which is inside or on  circle of radious K meter .
If User is at origin position (0,0). N cars position are given in (Xi,Yi) formate. Where 1<=i<=N .
If car can be booked give output as "Available" otherwise "Not Available" .
At that time employee is busy to solve other problem. Can you help him to solve this problem.
 
Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows."
Then for each test case, The first line contains two integers N number of car active in city
and K radious of circle within wich car are available or not.
The next N line contains space-separated integers Xi Yi  denoting the position (Xi,Yi) of ith car. 

 
Output

For each test case, output a single line "Available" if car can be booked otherwise "Not Available"..

 
Constraints

1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= K <= 5000
-10^4 <= Xi <= 10^4
-10^4 <= Yi <= 10^4

 
Example
Input:
2
4 5
4 8
3 4
1 13
-1 -5
3 3
1 5
-3 4
-4 -2

Output:
Available
Not Available
 
Explanation

In the first test case N is 4 and K is 5  since position (3,4) will lie on circle of radious 5 and (-1,-5)
is not inside the circle.
In the second test case N is 3 and K is 3 since not any position of lie on or inside the circle having radiou 3.
