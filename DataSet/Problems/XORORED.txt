Given an array AA of NN non-negative integers, you can choose any non-negative integer X and replace every element Ai with (Ai⊕X) Here, ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Using the above operation exactly once, your goal is to minimize the bitwise OR of the new array. In other words, find X such that (A1⊕X)∨⋯∨(AN⊕X) is minimized, where ∨ denotes the bitwise OR operation.
Find the value of X and the minimum possible bitwise OR of the new array.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N - the length of the array.
The next line contains N integers A1,…,AN.

Output Format
For each test case, print two integers: X and the minimum possible bitwise OR of the new array.
If there are multiple values of X that achieve the minimum bitwise OR, print any of them.
Constraints

1≤T≤5000
1≤N≤100
0≤Ai≤109

4 6



                        Sample Output 1
                        





6 2


Explanation
Here, if we take X=6, then our expression would become (4⊕6)∨(6⊕6)=2∨0=2, which is the minimum possible.
