It is snacks time for Ahmed. His friend, Ali, prepared him a nice game for lunch. Ali brought Ahmed nn ordered piles of snacks such that ii-th pile contains aiai snacks. He labeled all these snacks with consecutive integers: snacks in first pile are labeled with numbers 1 to a1, snacks in second pile are labeled with numbers a1 + 1 to a1 + a2 and so on. See the example for a better understanding.
Ahmed cannot eat all the snacks (Ali brought a lot) and he is blind, so Ali tells him the labels of the best tasty snacks. Ali will only give Ahmed a snack if Ahmed says correctly in which pile this snack is contained.
Poor Ahmed asks for your help. For all tasty snacks said by Ali, tell Ahmed the correct answers.
Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), the number of piles.
The second line contains n integers a1,a2,...,an (1≤ai≤103,a1+a2+...+an≤106), where ai is the number of snacks in the i-th pile.
The third line contains single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 105), the number of tasty snacks said by Ali.
The fourth line contains m integers q1, q2, ..., qm (1 ≤ qi ≤ a1 + a2 + ... + an), the labels of the tasty snacks.

Output
Print m lines to the standard output. The i-th line should contain an integer, representing the number of the pile where the snack labeled with the number qi is.
