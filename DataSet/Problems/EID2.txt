Eidi gifts are a tradition in which children receive money from elder relatives during the Eid celebration.
Chef has three children (numbered $1, 2, 3$) and he wants to give them Eidi gifts. The oldest child, Chefu, thinks that a distribution of money is fair only if an older child always receives more money than a younger child; if two children have the same age, they should receive the same amounts of money.
For each valid $i$, the $i$-th child is $A_i$ years old and it received $C_i$ units of money. Determine whether this distribution of money is fair.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains six space-separated integers $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$, $C_1$, $C_2$ and $C_3$.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "FAIR" if the distribution is fair or "NOT FAIR" otherwise.
Constraints

$1 \le T \le 1,000$
$1 \le A_1, A_2, A_3 \le 17$
$1 \le C_1, C_2, C_3 \le 100$

FAIR
NOT FAIR
NOT FAIR
NOT FAIR
FAIR


Explanation
Example case 2: All children have same age which is 5, but second child got less money than the other children, so it's not fair.
Example case 3: First child is older than second child but he got less money than him, so it's not fair.
Example case 4: First and third children have same age, but didn't get same amount of money,  so it's not fair.
