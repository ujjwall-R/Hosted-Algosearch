The Head Chef is interested in studying interactions between his chefs . There are  N  chefs with ids 1 to N . Each chef trusts some of the other chefs . The relation of trust is one way . Also , a chef may trust chefs only with ids strictly greater than his/her id .A chef with id = i , trusts the chefs with next ni id's.  
The Head Chef wants to know given a chef B and a set of chefs S,  how many lines of trust exist between each element of S and B . A line of trust between chefs A and B is a sequence of chefs a1 ... ak starting at A ( a1 = A )and finishing at B  (Ak = B) such that Ai trusts A(i+1)  for all i ( 1 to k-1) . Two lines of trust are different if they have a different chef at the some position in the line . 

Since the answer may be quite large , output it modulo 1000000007 .
Input
The first line contains a two space seperated integers N and  B denoting the number of chefs and the target chef for whom the lines of trust have to be calculated.  
The next  N lines contains an integer  ni denoting the number of chefs which are trusted by the chef with id = i .  
 The next line contains a single integer  Q  denoting the number of queries 
 The next  Q  lines contain elements of set S .
Output
Output a single line for each query containing the answer to the query.
Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 200000
1 ≤ B ≤ N
1 ≤ Q ≤ 100000
1 ≤ Each element of set S  < B
1 ≤ i + ni ( for i = 1 to N )  ≤ N
0 ≤ ni ( for i = 1 to N )  ≤ N - 1
