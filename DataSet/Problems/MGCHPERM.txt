Misha is an expert on combinatorics, so he knows a lot about permutations. Recently, he learned the definition of a convex polygon and invented too many new problems involving permutations. Please help him solve one of them.


Let's define a function on a set a with size k: F(a1, a2, ... , ak). Imagine that we have sticks of lengths a1, a2, ... , ak. F(a1, a2, ... , ak) = 1, if and only if a convex polygon can be created from these sticks. F(a1, a2, ... , ak) = 0, otherwise.


Misha has the identity permutation over n elements — In (In = {1, 2, 3, .. n}). He wants to know the sum of the function F over all possible distinct k-sized subsets of In.


Please help Misha find this sum. Since its value may be very large, you should output the sum modulo 109+7.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains two space-separated integers — n and k.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing a single integer — the solution of Misha's problem modulo 109+7.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 500
3 ≤ k ≤ 7
1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 109

Subtasks

Subtask 1: (10 pts) Sum of n over all test cases not be greater than 15.

Subtask 2: (20 pts) Sum of n over all test cases not be greater than 1000. 

Subtask 3: (30 pts) 1 ≤ n ≤ 106

Subtask 4: (40 pts) 1 ≤ n ≤ 109


Example
Input:
5
3 3
6 4
777 5
777777 7
1000000000 6

Output:
0
14
367816
989165211
930411765

Explanation:

Example case 1. There is only one subset: {1, 2, 3}. Since, F(1, 2, 3) = 0, the answer is 0.


Example case 2. There are C(6, 4) = 15 possible subsets. F(1, 2, 3, 6) = 0, and the value of F on all other subsets equals 1. 
Therefore, the answer is 15 - 1 = 14.
