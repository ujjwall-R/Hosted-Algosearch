You are given a tree with nn vertices numbered 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n. There are two players Alice and Bob who play a game on this tree, taking turns alternatively.  Alice starts.
In their turn a participant has to remove a leaf (and the edge adjacent to it) from the tree. A leaf is a node with degree 11. Please note, that the tree changes with the game progressing, and a node which is not a leaf in the beginning can become a leaf later and become eligible to be removed.
Alice likes the vertex x and wants it be the last node remaining. Bob hates node x and doesn't want it to be the last node remaining.
For all the choices of vertex x, find who wins assuming both play optimally.
Input
There are multiple independent testcases.

The first line contains T, the number of testcases.
The first line of each testcase contains a single interger n, the number of vertices.
Each of the next n−1 lines contains two integers denoting the endpoints of an edge. Each edge is present only once.

Output
For each testcase, print a string of length n on a new line. The ith character in this string should be 1 if Alice wins the game for x=i, and 0 if Bob wins.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
2≤n≤105
The sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 105.

Example Input
2
2
1 2
5
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5

Example Output
11
00000

Explanation
In the first testcase. If x=1, Alice removes node 2 and wins. If x=2, Alice removes node 1 and wins.
In the second testcase, consider x=1. If Alice removes node 2, Bob can remove node 1 in his turn and win. If Alice removes node 4, Bob then removes node 2. Then in her turn, Alice can only remove node 5 leaving two nodes 1 and 3. Bob can now remove node 1 and win. The game proceeds similarly if Alice removes node 5 first. So, Bob wins the game.
One can see that for other choices of x as well, Bob wins.
