Chef and his friend Chefu decided to go on a trip. The trip takes place over the next N days (numbered 1 through N). There are K different places Chef and Chefu could visit (numbered 1 through K). They have written a sequence A1,A2,…,AN which denotes the plan of the trip during these N days; however, the plan is not completed yet. For each valid i, they want to visit the place Ai on the i-th day, but if Ai=−1, then they haven't decided which place to visit on that day.
Chef and his friend do not want to visit the same place two days in a row, but they can visit a place more than once in total. It is not necessary to visit all the places during the trip. Determine whether it is possible to complete the plan in such a way that this condition is satisfied. If it is possible, find one way of completing the plan.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a line containing the string "YES" if it's possible the complete the plan or "NO" otherwise.
If it's possible to complete the plan, print a second line containing N space-separated integers denoting the sequence A1,A2,…,AN after completing the plan. If there is more than one solution, you may print any one.
