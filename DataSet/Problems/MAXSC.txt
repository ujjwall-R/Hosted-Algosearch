You are given N integer sequences A1, A2, ..., AN. Each of these sequences contains N elements. You should pick N elements, one from each sequence; let's denote the element picked from sequence Ai by Ei. For each i (2 ≤ i ≤ N), Ei should be strictly greater than Ei-1.
Compute the maximum possible value of E1 + E2 + ... + EN. If it's impossible to pick the elements E1, E2, ..., EN, print -1 instead.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
N lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains N space-separated integers Ai1, Ai2, ..., AiN denoting the elements of the sequence Ai.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum sum of picked elements.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 700
1 ≤ sum of N in all test-cases ≤ 3700
1 ≤ Aij ≤ 109 for each valid i, j

Subtasks

Subtask #1 (18 points): 1 ≤ Aij ≤ N for each valid i, j

18


Explanation
Example case 1: To maximise the score, pick 3 from the first row, 6 from the second row and 9 from the third row. The resulting sum is E1+E2+E3 = 3+6+9 = 18.
