Chef Dengklek will open a new restaurant in the city. The restaurant will be open for N days. He can cook M different types of dish. He would like to cook a single dish every day, such that for the entire N days, he only cook at most K distinct types of dishes.
In how many ways can he do that?
Input
The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of a single line consisting of three integers N, M, K.
Output
For each test case, output a single line consisting the number of different ways he can cook for the entire N days, modulo 1000000007.
Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
1 ≤ M ≤ 1000000
1 ≤ K ≤ 1000
