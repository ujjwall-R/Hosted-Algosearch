Chef loves graphs. To express his love, he defines a function f(G,x,y)f(G,x,y) for an undirected connected graph GG with weighted edges and two of its vertices xx, y. f(G,x,y) is defined as the minimum of weights of all paths in G between the vertices x and y, where the weight of a path is the maximum of weights of edges in this path.
Chef has two connected graphs G1 and G2. Each of these graphs has N vertices (labelled 1 through N) and M edges. Calculate S=N−1∑i=1N∑j=i+1f(G1,i,j)⋅f(G2,i,j) modulo 998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and M.
M lines follow. Each of these lines contains three space-separated integers u, v and w denoting that vertices u and v in G1 are connected by an edge with weight w.
M more lines follow. Each of these lines contains three space-separated integers u, v and w denoting that vertices u and v in G2 are connected by an edge with weight w.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the sum S modulo 998,244,353.
