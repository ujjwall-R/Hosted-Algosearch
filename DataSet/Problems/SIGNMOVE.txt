Initially, Chef is at coordinate 00 on X-axis. For each i=1,2,…,Ni=1,2,…,N in order, Chef does the following:

If Chef is at a non-negative coordinate, he moves ii steps backward (i.e, his position's coordinate decreases by i), otherwise he moves i steps forward (i.e, his position's coordinate increases by i). 

You are given the integer N. Find the final position of Chef on the X-axis after N operations.
Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow:
The first and only line of each test case contains an integer N.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the final position of Chef on the X-axis after N operations.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤N≤109

Explanation
Test case 1: Initially, Chef is at coordinate 0 on X-axis. As 0 is non-negative, during the first operation Chef moves 1 step backward and reaches the coordinate −1.
Test case 2: Chef is at coordinate −1 on X-axis after the first operation. As −1 is negative, during the second operation Chef moves 2 steps forward and reaches the coordinate 1.
