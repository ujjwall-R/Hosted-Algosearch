Explanation
Test Case 1: The amount of water in the tank is 8 litres. The capacity of each bottle is 2 litres. Hence, 4 water bottles can be filled completely.
Test Case 2: The amount of water in the tank is 4 litres. The capacity of each bottle is 5 litres. Hence, no water bottle can be filled completely.
Test Case 3: The amount of water in the tank is 4 litres. The capacity of each bottle is 1 litre. Chef has 3 bottles available. He can fill all these bottles completely using 3 litres of water.
