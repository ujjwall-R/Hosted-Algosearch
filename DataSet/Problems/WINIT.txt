You want to propose a girl named Cecile, but she is not a fool, she wants an intelligent boyfriend. So, she asks you to solve a problem in order to be her boyfriend.
You are given an array (Indexing starts from 1) consisting of NN numbers and you are asked MM queries of two types. The following are the two types of queries.
11 X Y ∶-Change the element of the array at position X to Y.
2 L R ∶- If d = product of numbers of the array from index L to R(included both L and R), then Print the total count of numbers (1≤number≤d) whose GCD with d is 1. As the count will be large so print the count modulo 109+7 .
Note: The number of different prime factors of all the numbers in the array at any instant will be less than or equal to 10.
Input:

First-line consists of two integers N, M  separated by a space.
Second-line consists of N integers of the array separated by space.
Next, M lines contains the M queries, each query contains 3 integers T A B separated by space, where T= type of queries and A and B are the required numbers according to the query.

Output:
For each query of type 2, print the required answer in a new line.
Constraints

1≤N,M≤100000
1≤Ai,Y≤1000000 ,where 1≤i≤N, Ai  is the ith  element of the array.
1≤L,R,X≤N

Sample Input:
6 3
3 6 9 10 2 5
2 5 6
1 2 1
2 1 2

Sample Output:
4
2

EXPLANATION:
For the first query, the product of array element from index 5 to 6 is 10 and there are a total of 4 positive numbers less than or equal to 10 whose gcd with 10 is 1. they are {1,3,7,9}.
For the second query, the array element at index 2 changed, so the new array will be  A=[3,1,9,10,2,5].
And again for  3rd query, the product of array element from index 1 to 2 is 3 and there are a total of 2 positive numbers less than or equal to 3 whose gcd with 3 is 1. they are {1,2}.
