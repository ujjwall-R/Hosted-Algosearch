Chef has a combination lock with NN wheels (numbered 11 through NN). For each valid ii, on the ii-th wheel, the integers from 00 to AiAi (inclusive) are written in ascending order (00 and AiAi are also adjacent). Initially, one value on each wheel is selected uniformly randomly and independently.
The lock operates in a very peculiar way: it opens when there is at least one wheel where either 00 or the largest value on that wheel is selected. Chef wants to open the lock using the smallest possible number of operations; in one operation, he may choose one wheel and rotate it clockwise or counterclockwise by 11 unit (i.e. select a value that is adjacent to the previously selected value on that wheel).
Find the expected value of the number of operations which Chef needs to perform to open the lock.
The expected number of operations can be represented as a fraction PQPQ, where PP is a non-negative integer and QQ a positive integer coprime with 998,244,353998,244,353. You should calculate P⋅Q−1 modulo 998,244,353, where Q−1 denotes the multiplicative inverse of Q modulo 998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer P⋅Q−1 modulo 998,244,353.
