You are given a string s with length n. You should find a permutation P of numbers 1 through n such that if you apply this permutation on the string s, you will get a palindromic string.
The result of applying a permutation P on the string s is a string t with length n such that for each i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), the i-th character of t is given as as t[i] = s[Pi].
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains the string s.
Output
For each test case, print a single line. If it is impossible to find a valid permutation P, this line should contain a single integer -1. Otherwise, it should contain n space-separated integers P1, P2, ..., Pn.
If there are multiple valid permutations, you may print any one.
Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 105
s will consist only of lowercase English letters (i.e. characters 'a' through 'z')
Subtasks
Subtask #1 (20 points): 1 ≤ T, n ≤ 10
Subtask #2 (20 points): 1 ≤ T, n ≤ 100
Subtask #3 (60 points): 1 ≤ T ≤ 10

                        Sample Input 1
                        





4
aa
baa
abc
abab



                        Sample Output 1
                        





1 2
2 1 3
-1
1 2 4 3


Explanation
Example case 1: The string t obtained using the identity permutation will have t[1] = s[1] and t[2] = s[2]. That means t = "aa", which is a palindrome.
Example case 2: The characters of the string t obtained by applying the permutation 2, 1, 3 are t[1] = s[2], t[2] = s[1] and t[3] = s[3]. Therefore, t = "aba", which is a palindrome.
Example case 3: There is no way to find a permutation P such that we can obtain a palindrome from s using it.
Example case 4: Applying the permutation 1, 2, 4, 3 on s results in t = "abba", which is a palindrome. Another permutation that you may apply is 2, 1, 3, 4; this results in t = "baab", which is also a palindrome.
