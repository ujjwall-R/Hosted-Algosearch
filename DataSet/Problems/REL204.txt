After iFest'16 was finished Harsh and his team were sitting tired. And they all were exhausted. But as we all know Harsh is workaholic and never sits idle. He always brags about how powerful he is in maths and there is no puzzle that he can't solve.  So committee decides to give him a problem and prove that he is wrong. They keep a bet that if he solves this problem all will take him to dinner else he will pay. Now Harsh is so tired and needs your help to solve this problem.
The problem was as follows. Harsh's favourite numbers are 6 and 5. So they decided to give Harsh N single digit numbers. They asked him to form a new number with the given N numbers in such a way that the newly formed number should be completely divisible by 5 and 6. They told him that he should also form the number from these digits in such a way that the formed number is maximum. He may or may not use all the given numbers. But he is not allowed to use leading zeros. However, the answer can be 0 because 0 is divisible by both 5 and 6. Though he is allowed to leave out some of the numbers, he is not allowed to add any extra numbers, which means the maximum count of each digit in the newly formed number, is the same as the number of times that number is present in those given N digits.

Input

First line contains T, the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one integer N, size of the array.
Next line contains contains N single digit integers.

Output

For each test case output a single number, where the above said conditions are satisfied. If it is not possible to create such a number with the given constraints print -1.If there exists a solution, the maximised number should be greater than or equal to 0.

Constraints

1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 10000
0 <= Each digit <= 9

Example
Input:
2
12
3 1 2 3 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 3
11
3 9 9 6 4 3 6 4 9 6 0

Output:
33322222200
999666330
