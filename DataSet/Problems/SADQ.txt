"The Mean Absolute Difference is a measure of statistical dispersion equal to the average absolute difference of two independent values drawn from a probability distribution." - Wikipedia 
 In this problem we are concerned not with Mean Absolute Difference (MAD) of two distributions but rather with the Summed Absolute Difference (SAD) of two arrays. Given arrays (1-indexed) P and Q of lengths p and q, define


 Given a collection of K arrays A1, ..., AK, report SAD(Ai, Aj) for several queries (i, j). 
Input

The first line of input contains a single positive integer K.
Each of the next K lines starts with a positive integer si, the size of Ai, followed by si space-separated integers Ai,1, ..., Ai,si which denotes the array Ai. 
 The next line of input consists of a single positive integer M. 
 Each of the next M lines consists of 2 positive integers i and j which lie between 1 and K (inclusive), specifying the indices of the arrays for which the SAD value must be reported.

Output
Output M lines. Line i should contain the answer to query i.
Constraints

1 ≤ K, M ≤ 105
1 ≤ s1 + ... + sK ≤  105
-109 ≤ Ai,j ≤ 109
1 ≤ i, j ≤ K in each of the queries

Example
Input:
4
4 0 3 1 -2 
2 0 4 
2 2 4 
4 4 -3 -4 4 
3
3 4
4 2
1 4

Output:
30
30
60

Explanation:
Query 1: The arrays in question are A3 = [2, 4] and A4 = [4, -3, -4, 4].

SAD(A3, A4) = |2 - 4| + | 2 - (-3) | + |2 - (-4) | + | 2 - 4 | + | 4 - 4 | + | 4 - (-3) | + | 4 - (-4) | + | 4 - 4 | 
                       = 2 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 0 + 7 + 8 + 0 
                       = 30
