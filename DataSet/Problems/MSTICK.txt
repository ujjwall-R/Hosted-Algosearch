Chef Ceil has some matchsticks in his kitchen.
Detail of matchsticks:
There are NN matchsticks in total. They are numbered from to 00 to N−1N−1 inclusive. The ith matchstick takes bi time to burn when lighted at one end, and it burns at a uniform rate.
If lighted at both ends simultaneously, the matchstick will take only half of the original time to burn down.
Arrangement:
He ties rear end of the all the matchsticks together at one point and the front end is kept free. The matchstick numbered i is adjacent to matchstick numbered i+1 for all 0≤i≤N−2.  
Bodies of matchsticks do not touch each other, except at the rear end.
Task:
There are Q queries, in each query we ask:
If he lights the free end of all matchsticks numbered between L and R inclusive, what will be the time needed for all matchsticks to get completely burnt?
Input

First line of input contains a single integer N. 
The next line contains N space separated integers, the ith of which is bi
The next line contains a single integer Q
The next Q lines each contain two space separated integers - L and R. The ith line represents the ith query.

Output
For each query, print the answer on a new line. 
Constraints:

1≤N≤105
1≤bi≤108
1≤Q≤105
0≤L≤R≤N−1

9.0


Explanation
Test Case 3: , in the figure above, yellow colored matches are lighted by a lighter simultaneously.
The numbers indicate the time required to burn that matchstick (if lighted at one end).
Now the first lighted matchstick will completely burn in 5 seconds. Then it will light up all the rest matches from the rear end.
Some matches will have fire at both ends and thus after 5 seconds, they will start burning with twice the original rate.
Thus time taken for matches to burn completely will be :
(from left to right):  8.0, 9.0, 7.0, 6.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 6.0, 7.5, 5.0, 8.5, 8.0, 6.0, 6.0, 7.0, 6.0, 8.0, 7.0.
So, the answer will be 9.0 (the maximum among these).
