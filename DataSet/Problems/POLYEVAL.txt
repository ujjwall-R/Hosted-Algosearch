You are given a polynomial of degree N with integer coefficients. Your task is to find the value of this polynomial at some K different integers, modulo 786433.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer N denoting the degree of the polynomial.
The following line of each test case contains (N+1) integers denoting the coefficients of the polynomial. The ith numbers in this line denotes the coefficient ai-1 in the polynomial a0 + a1 × x1 + a2 × x2 + ... + aN × xN. 
The following line contains a single integer Q denoting the number of queries.
The jth of the following Q lines contains an integer number xj denoting the query.
Output
For each query, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding query. In other words, the jth line of the output should have an integer equal to a0 + a1 × xj + a2 × xj2 + ... + aN × xjN modulo 786433.

Constraints and Subtasks


0 ≤ ai, xj < 786433
Subtask #1 (37 points): 0 ≤ N, Q ≤ 1000
Subtask #2 (63 points): 0 ≤ N, Q ≤ 2.5 × 105


Example
Input:
2
1 2 3
3
7
8
9

Output:
162
209
262

Explanation
Example case 1.

Query 1: 1 + 2 × 7 + 3 × 7 × 7 = 162
Query 2: 1 + 2 × 8 + 3 × 8 × 8 = 209
Query 3: 1 + 2 × 9 + 3 × 9 × 9 = 262
