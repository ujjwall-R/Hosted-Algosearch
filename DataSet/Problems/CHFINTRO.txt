What the hell are all these interactive problems? What does flushing output mean? So many questions… Chef explains it in an easy way: you must communicate with a grader program, which accepts your input only if you flushed the output.
There is a contest with interactive problems where N people participate. Each contestant has a known rating. Chef wants to know which contestants will not forget to flush the output in interactive problems. Fortunately, he knows that contestants with rating at least r never forget to flush their output and contestants with rating smaller than r always forget to do it. Help Chef!
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and r.
Each of the following N lines contains a single integer R denoting the rating of one contestant.

Output
For each contestant, print a single line containing the string "Good boi" if this contestant does not forget to flush the output or "Bad boi" otherwise.
