Danya has a rooted tree with N nodes (numbered 1 through N). Node 1 is the root and for each i (2≤i≤N), the parent of the i-th node is pi. For each valid i, the i-th node also has a value ai.
Danya really loves his tree and wants to play with it. You should answer his Q queries. In each query:

You are given two integers X and D.
Consider the set S of all nodes v that lie in the subtree of node X (including X) such that the distance between X and v does not exceed D.
The answer to this query is the number of different values av among all v∈S.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N−1 space-separated integers p2,p3,…,pN.
The third line contains N space-separated integers a1,a2,…,aN.
The fourth line contains a single integer Q.
Q lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers x and d describing a query; the parameters X and D can be computed in the following way:
Let's denote the answer to the previous query by ans (ans=0 if this is the first query).
Then, X=x⊕ans and D=d⊕ans, where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operator.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer ― the answer to the query.
