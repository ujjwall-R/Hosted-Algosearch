Chef has always been fond of girls, but he could not make any girl his friend. In order to finally make one, he was asked to solve the following problem:
You are given a string SS with length NN. Choose an integer KK and two non-empty subsequences A and B of characters of this string, each with length K, such that:

A=B, i.e. for each valid i, the i-th character in A is the same as the i-th character in B.
Let's denote the indices of characters used to construct A by a1,a2,…,aK, i.e. A=(Sa1,Sa2,…,SaK). Similarly, let's denote the indices of characters used to construct B by b1,b2,…,bK.
If we denote the number of common indices in the sequences a and b by M, then M+1≤K.

Since Chef is busy right now, he asks you to find the maximum value of K such that it is possible to find sequences A and B which satisfy the given conditions or determine that there is no such K.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains a single string S with length N.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum K, or 0 if there is no solution.
Constraints

1≤N≤105
S contains only lowercase English letters
