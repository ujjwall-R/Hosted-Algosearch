The next line of the input contains 2 space separated integers N and K. N denotes the total number of players and K denotes the number of players allowed in a team.
The next line of the input contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,A3...An where ith number denotes power of ith player.

Note: power of players can also be negative
Output:

For each test-case print the total power that your selected team have(each test case output must be printed on a new line).

Constraints:

1≤T≤103
1≤N,K≤105
−107≤A1,A2,A3...An≤107

Sample Input:
