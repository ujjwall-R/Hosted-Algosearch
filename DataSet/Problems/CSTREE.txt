You are given a small graph GsGs with NN nodes (numbered 1 through N) and M edges.
Let's create a big graph Gb with NK nodes (numbered 1 through NK) and MK edges. Gb consists of K copies of Gs ― formally, for each k (0≤k≤K−1) and each edge between nodes u and v in Gs, there is an edge between nodes u+kN and v+kN in Gb.
Afterwards, let's take the complement of Gb and call it H ― formally, H is a graph with NK nodes (numbered 1 through NK) such that for each pair of nodes, there is an edge between these two nodes in H if and only if there is no edge between these two nodes in Gb.
Count the number of spanning trees in H. Since this number could be very large, compute it modulo 998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M and K.
Each of the next M lines contains two space-separated integers a and b denoting that the nodes a and b in Gs are connected by an edge.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of spanning trees in H modulo 998,244,353.

Explanation
Example case 1: H is the complete graph on three nodes, so the number of spanning trees is 3 (any two of the edges form a spanning tree).
