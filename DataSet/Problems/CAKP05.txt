Halry likes Lucky number whereas Harry doesn't. Harry likes nearly lucky numbers. 
Suppose you have an integer MM. 
If the number of lucky digits in MM is a lucky number and sum of the digits of the number MM is also lucky then, the number is said to be nearly lucky. 
Halry decides to give some numbers and asks harry to find how many numbers are lucky, nearly lucky or none.
Note: If a number is both lucky and nearly lucky, consider it as only lucky.

1st integer is count of lucky numbers in array.
2nd integer is count of nearly lucky numbers in array.
3rd integer is count of numbers that are neither lucky nor nearly lucky.

Constraints

1≤N≤106
1≤Ai≤1018

Sample Output:
1 2 2


EXPLANATION:
Lucky Number - 77  
Nearly Lucky Numbers - 
787877 (Total lucky digits here are 4 and sum of digits is 44)
