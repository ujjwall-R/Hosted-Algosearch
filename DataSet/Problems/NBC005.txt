Chefina  is  always interested to play with string. But due to exam pressure she has no time to solve a string problem. She wants your help. Can you help her to solve that problem?
You are given a string. You have to find out the WonderWonder SumSum of the string. WonderWonder Sum of a string is defined as the sum of the value of each character of the string. 
The value of each character means:

If the string is started with "a" , then the value of each character of the string is like "a"=100, "b"=101, "c"="102" ………"z"=125.
If the string is started with "z" , then the value of each character of the string is like "a"=2600, "b"=2601, "c"="2602" ………"z"=2625.

Since even the Wonder Sum can be large, output Wonder Sum modulo  (109+7).
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, a string S with lower case alphabet 
only.

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line integer i.e.  Wonder Sum modulo  (109+7).
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
1≤|S|≤105

Sample Input:
2
cab

sdef
Sample Output:
903

7630
EXPLANATION:
i) For the first test case, since the string is started with "c", so output is (302+300+301)=903
ii)For the second test case, since the string is started with "s", so output is (1918+1903+1904+1905)=7630
