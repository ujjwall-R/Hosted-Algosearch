Today Chef met his old friend Cheftor who is currently working on Artificial Intelligence (AI in short) which can predict the temperature of any place.  
He asks the Chef to help him evaluate the performance of the AI by comparing the actual temperature with the temperature predicted by the AI. However Chef and Cheftor both know that the temperature predicted by the AI cannot be accurate always, so they decided to allow a minimum error in the predicted values.
Given the values of actual temperature tt, the predicted temperature pp and the minimum error allowed e, if the difference between the predicted value and the actual value is  less than or equal  to the allowed minimum error then AI passes the evaluation otherwise not.
Print a single line containing the string "PASSED" (without quotes) if the AI passed the test otherwise print "FAILED" (without quotes). 
Note that the output should be in upper case only. "passed", "Passed" or any such output will receive the wrong answer verdict.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains three space separated integers t , p and e for the actual temperature, temperature predicted by the AI and the minimum allowed error respectively

Output:
For each testcase, print a single line containing the string "PASSED" (without quotes) if the AI passed the test otherwise print "FAILED" (without quotes)
Constraints 

1≤T≤10
0≤t≤100
0≤p≤100
0≤e≤10

Sample Input:
2
25 20 5
80 100 10

Sample Output:
PASSED
FAILED

EXPLANATION:
For the first test case
the  error is 25−20=5 
and since 5≤5 the AI passed this test
For the second test case
the absolute error is 100−80=20 
and since 20≤10 is not true the AI fails
