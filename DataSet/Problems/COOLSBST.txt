An integer XX is cool if it has a primitive root modulo XX.
The coolness of a non-empty set of NN distinct integers S={x1,x2,…,xN} is the number of cool divisors of ∏Ni=1xi.
You are given four integers L, R, A and B. Let S be the set containing all integers between L and R (inclusive). Consider all non-empty subsets of S with size between A and B (inclusive). Find the sum of values of coolness of all these subsets. Since this sum can be huge, compute it modulo 998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers L, R, A and B. 

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the total coolness modulo 998,244,353.

Explanation
Example case 1: We have S = {3,4}, which has the following 3 non-empty subsets with sizes in the range [1,2]:

{3}: coolness 2, the cool divisors are {1,3}
{4}: coolness 3, the cool divisors are {1,2,4}
{3,4}: coolness 5, the cool divisors are {1,2,3,4,6}

Example case 2: There are no subsets with size in the range [15,20], so the sum is 0.
