 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
You are given a Cartesian plane, and you are asked to support the following three kinds of operations:

I x1 y1 x2 y2: add an axes-parallel rectangle on the plane. The bottom-left corner has coordinates (x1, y1), the top-right one has coordinates (x2, y2) 
D index: remove the retangle that was added during the index-th addition operation
Q x1 y1 x2 y2: output the number of rectangles on the plane that have the common area with the rectangle with a bottom-left corner coordinates (x1, y1) and a top-right corner coordinates (x2, y2).
Please notice that, even if the two rectangles only share a common point, they are still regarded as sharing common area


Also, there can be a few same rectangles on the plane, they should be regarded as a few different rectangles.
There are Q operations in all, can you fulfill them?
Input
The first line contains an integer Q.
The next Q lines represent the operations you are to deal with. Each of them contains an operation in one of the three forms above.
Output
For each Q-type operation, output the result on the separate line of the output.
Constraints

1 <= Q <= 100000
1 <= x1 <= x2 <= 109
1 <= y1 <= y2 <= 109


Example

Input:
5
I 1 1 2 2
I 2 2 3 3
Q 3 3 4 4 
D 2
Q 3 3 4 4

Output:
1
0  
Explanation

In the third operation, the rectangle (2, 2)-(3, 3) has a common point with the given rectangle.
But in the fifth operation, as the rectangle (2, 2)-(3, 3) has been removed, so there are no rectangles that has the common area with the given rectangle.
