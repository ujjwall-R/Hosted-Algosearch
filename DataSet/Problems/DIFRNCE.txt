The chef has received a problem from his friend who is a chemist.
He has got n candies.
This all candies have some sucrose level.
He has to eat such candy whose sucrose level is the difference of sucrose level of candy with maximum and minimum sucrose level.
Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains of two line of input.
First-line contains an integer n, no of candies.
Second-line contains array A of sucrose level of all n candies.

Output:
For each test case, output in a single line answer printing sucrose level of candy that chef will eat Or printing  NO if the chef doesn't find the candy with appropriate sucrose level he needs.
Constraints

1≤T≤101≤T≤10
1≤n≤101≤n≤10
1≤A[i]≤10001≤A[i]≤1000
0≤i≤(n−1)

Sample Input:
 2
 5
 2 1 3 4 5
 3
 3 2 2

Sample Output:
 4
 NO

EXPLANATION:
For 1st test case:
This array is :
[2,1,3,4,5] .Here, maximum sucrose level is 5 and minimum sucrose level is 1.
Their difference gives a sucrose level 4 which is present in a given array.
Hence the answer is 4.
For 2nd test case:
This array is :
[3,2,2] .Here, maximum sucrose level is 3 and the minimum sucrose level is 2.
Their difference gives a sucrose level 1.which is not present in a given array.so, he will not eat candy.so we will print no.
Hence the answer is NO.
