After learning to solve maximum sum subarray problem, it's time for you to solve the maximum product subsequence.
You're given an array of N integers, and a number K. 
The maximum K-product of the array is the maximum product of any K length subsequence of the array. For example, the maximum 2-product of the array  [-5, 3, 4, -6] is 30 because the product of the subsequence [-5, -6] is 30 and it is impossible to achieve larger subsequence product.
What is the maximum K-product you can achieve? Since the answer can be very large, output it modulo 109 + 7.
Note:  Recall that the result of a modulo operation is always non-negative. For example, -8 mod 5 = 2.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN, denoting the elements of the array. 
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the maximum K-product of the array.
Constraints


1 ≤ T ≤ 105
1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 105
-109 ≤ Ai ≤ 109
The sum of the Ns over all the test cases in a single test file is ≤ 5×105

Example
Input:
4
4 2
5 -3 -4 6
4 2
-5 3 4 -6
3 2
10000 100000 100000
2 1
-1 -2

Output:
30
30
999999937
1000000006

Explanation
Example case 1. The maximum 2-product of the array [5, -3, -4, 6] is 30 and is achieved by the subsequence [5, 6].
Example case 2. The maximum 2-product of the array [-5, 3, 4, -6] is 30 and is achieved by the subsequence [-5, -6].
Example case 3. The maximum 2-product of the array [10000, 100000, 100000] is 10000000000 and is achieved by the subsequence [100000,100000]. Modulo 109 + 7, this is 999999937.
Example case 4. The maximum 1-product of the array [-1, -2] is -1 and is achieved by the subsequence [-1]. Modulo 109 + 7, this is 1000000006.
The reason why -1 mod (109 + 7) = 1000000006 is that for positive m, a mod m is defined as the smallest nonnegative integer b such that a - b is divisible by m.
