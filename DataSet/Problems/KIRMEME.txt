Memeland is a country consisting of N cities. There are exactly N - 1 undirected roads connecting pairs of cities and there is exactly one path between each pair of cities (a path is a sequence of distinct cities where consecutive cities in the sequence are connected by a road).


As the country is located in mountains, cities may be at different heights. The heigh of i-th city is ai.


Kirito is going to travel around Memeland. Kirito is an unusual man, thus he wants to travel only interesting routes. He calls a sequence of cities i1, i2, ..., iK an interesting route if:

 no two cities in the sequence are the same: i.e. ij ≠ ij' for any two j ≠ j'.
 cities ij and ij+1 are connected by a road for each 1 ≤ j < K.
 the number of indices j with 1 < j < K with aij-1 < aij > aij+1 is at least L and at most R for some given L and R.



Help Kirito count the number of interesting routes in Memeland.


Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.


The first line of each test case contains one integer N denoting the number of cities in Memeland.
The second line of each test case contains two integers: L and R described in the statement.

The third line of each test case contains N integers where i-th integer is ai, the height of i-th city. The final N - 1 lines contain two integers denoting pairs of cities that are connected by roads.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing one integer denoting amount of interesting routes.
