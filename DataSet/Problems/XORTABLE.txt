There are two integer sequences A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and B1,B2,…,BMB1,B2,…,BM. You do not know the exact values of their elements, but you know that Li≤Ai≤RiLi≤Ai≤Ri for each valid i and Pi≤Bi≤Qi for each valid i.
You also have a matrix C with N rows and M columns. Some elements of C are missing. For each element Ci,j (1≤i≤N, 1≤j≤M) that is not missing, you know that Ci,j=Ai⊕Bj (⊕ denotes bitwise XOR).
Your task is to find two sequences A and B satisfying all given conditions. If multiple solutions exist, you may find any one.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M. 
N lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤N), the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Li and Ri.
M lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤M), the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Pi and Qi.
N more lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤N), the i-th of these lines contains M space-separated integers Ci,1,Ci,2,…,Ci,M. Missing elements are denoted by −1.

Output
For each test case:

If no solution exists, print a single line containing the string "NO".
Otherwise, print three lines. The first line should contain the string "YES". The second line should contain N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN. The third line should contain M space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BM.
