On a random day, Ayushi came running to her hostel to UN-box her parcel, that she received from an e-commerce website as a gift from an unknown guy. To her surprise, the parcel had a secured case, which prompted her to play a small game to break into the security.
The game was simple.
Ayushi was asked to enter a number N and she had to find the largest number having N digit which is the "Samosa Number".
"Samosa number" is developed by a "Samosa" Lover, that unknown boy.
A number P is a Samosa Number if it follows the following three criteria :
1.The number should consist of the odd digit at the odd positions but starts with an even digit.
2.The number consists of each digit from 1 to N at most once.
3.The number is prime.
Ayushi was not so genius neither a coder, so she came running to you for the code. Are you willing to solve the problem for her, provided she is extremely cute and single, searching for a coder friend.
INPUT
A single integer (1≤N≤8). The number consists of integers from 1 to N but doesn't consist of 0.
OUTPUT
The largest number of N digit that is a Samosa Number.
If it doesn't exist, then output "Dont Exist for N"(Value of N) without the quotes.

Sample Input
2

Sample Output

Sample Input
4

Sample Output
4231
