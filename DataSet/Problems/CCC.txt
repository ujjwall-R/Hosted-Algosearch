Nikki has NN coconuts, she wants to prepare a special coconut soup for her best friend Mansi. In order to make this soup, she has to break ZZ coconuts. For each coconut, there is a fixed number of times Nikki needs to hit it if she wants it to break. Nikki can only hit one coconut at the same time.
Their friend Sakshi is a troublemaker. This time, Sakshi shuffled the coconuts in some (unknown) way. You are given a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN with the following meaning: it is possible to label the coconuts 1 through N in such a way that for each valid i, the i-th coconut needs to be hit exactly Ai times to break.
Nikki wants to prepare the soup as soon as possible, so she wants to minimise the number of times she has to hit coconuts in the worst case in order to break Z coconuts. Formally, she wants to find a strategy of hitting coconuts, possibly depending on which coconuts broke after which hits, such that no matter which coconuts broke and when, it is guaranteed that after H hits, there will be Z broken coconuts, and there is no strategy with smaller H. Help Nikki find H — the minimum required number of hits.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Z.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum required number of hits.

Explanation
Example case 1: Nikki can choose one coconut and try to hit it 55 times. It will break either after the 50-th hit or after the 55-th hit.
Example case 2: Nikki can choose one coconut and hit it 40 times. If it does not break, the other coconut must be the one that takes 40 hits to break, so she should hit the other coconut 40 times. In total, she needs to hit coconuts at most 80 times.
