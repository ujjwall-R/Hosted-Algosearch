There were N students (numbered 1 through N) participating in the Indian Programming Camp (IPC) and they watched a total of K lectures (numbered 1 through K). For each student i and each lecture j, the i-th student watched the j-th lecture for Ti,j minutes.
Additionally, for each student i, we know that this student asked the question, "What is the criteria for getting a certificate?" Qi times.
The criteria for getting a certificate is that a student must have watched at least M minutes of lectures in total and they must have asked the question no more than 10 times.
Find out how many participants are eligible for a certificate.
Input

The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers N, M and K.
N lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains K+1 space-separated integers Ti,1,Ti,2,…,Ti,K,Qi.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the number of participants eligible for a certificate. 
Constraints

1≤N,K≤1,000
1≤M≤106
1≤Qi≤106 for each valid i
1≤Ti,j≤1,000 for each valid i and j

Explanation

Participant 1 watched 1+2+1+2=6 minutes of lectures and asked the question 5 times. Since 6<M, this participant does not receive a certificate.
Participant 2 watched 3+5+1+3=12 minutes of lectures and asked the question 4 times. Since 12≥M and 4≤10, this participant receives a certificate.
Participant 3 watched 1+2+4+5=12 minutes of lectures and asked the question 11 times. Since 12≥M but 11>10, this participant does not receive a certificate.
Participant 4 watched 1+1+1+3=6 minutes of lectures and asked the question 12 times. Since 6<M and 12>10, this participant does not receive a certificate.

Only participant 2 receives a certificate.
