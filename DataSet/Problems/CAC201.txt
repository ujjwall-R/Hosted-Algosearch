You are given an array AA (having the values of all elements in range [0,2000])  of length N. Each index i∈[1,N] has an initial weight of Wi units. You have to perform Q queries. The queries can be of 2 types:

Type 1:    1 X
Type 2:    2 V L R

Type 1 queries ask you to increase the weight of all indices by X units.
Type 2 queries ask you to calculate the total weight contributed by elements having value V in the index range [L,R]
Note: Use fast input/output methods. If you want to submit code in Python/Python 3 then submit the same code in PyPy /PyPy 3.
Input

First line contains T, the number of testcases. Each testcase is described as follows:
First line of testcase contains two integers N and Q, denoting the length of string and the number of queries
Second line of testcase contains N space separated integers, ith of these represents Ai ( for 1≤i≤N )
Third line of the testcase contains N space separated integers denoting Wi ( for 1≤i≤N )
Q more lines follow, each line will contain a query as described in the problem statement

Output
For each query of Type 2, print a line containing the answer for query
Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤N,Q≤105
0≤Ai,V≤2000
0≤Wi,X≤100
1≤L≤R≤N
The sum of N over all testcases does not exceed 5∗105
The sum of Qover all testcases does not exceed 5∗105

Subtasks

Subtask 1 (10 points): 1≤N,Q≤100
Subtask 2 (20 points): All elements of A have same value, i.e. Ai=Aj ∀i,j∈[1,N]
Subtask 3 (20 points): 0≤Ai≤25 and here are no queries of Type 1
Subtask 4 (20 points): 0≤Ai≤25
Subtask 5 (30 points): Original Constraints

Explanation
Sample Case 1:

Initial weights are: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
1st query is of Type 2, and the contribution of value 1 is asked. Since it is present only at index 1 in the range [1,10], hence total contribution of value 1=W1=0 units
2nd query is of Type 2, and the contribution of value 3 is asked. Since it is present at indices {3,4,9} hence, total contribution of value 3=W3+W4+W9=2+3+8=13 units
3rd query is of Type 1 which asks to increase the weights by 3 units, hence the new weights will be {3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}
Answer for 4th query =W0=3 units
Answer for 5th query =W3+W4+W9=5+6+11=22 units
