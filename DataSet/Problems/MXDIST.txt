Read problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
You are given NN points (x1,y1),(x2,y2),…,(xN,yN)(x1,y1),(x2,y2),…,(xN,yN).
You should answer Q queries. In each query, you are given a range [f,t]. Consider the points (xf,yf),(xf+1,yf+1),…,(xt,yt); the answer to a query is the square of the maximum Euclidean distance between any two of these points.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N.
N lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤N), the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers xi and yi.
The next line contains a single integer Q.
Each of the next Q lines contains two space-separated integers f and t describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the squared maximum distance.
Constraints

1≤N,Q≤2⋅105
1≤f≤t≤N
0≤xi,yi≤2⋅105 for each valid i

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (15 points): 1≤N,Q≤3,000, TL=1.5s
Subtask #2 (35 points): the coordinates of all points are chosen uniformly randomly, TL=5s
Subtask #3 (50 points): original constraints, TL=5s
