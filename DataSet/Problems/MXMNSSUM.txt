You are given a positive integer kk and an array aa consisting of nn integers. You will partition the array into k non-empty segments such that each number belongs to exactly one segment. 
Let's denote si as the sum of all numbers belonging to i-th segment after partitioning. Your goal is to maximize the value of min(s1,…,sk). Calculate and print this value.  
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case contains two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers n and k.
The second line of each test case contains n space-separated integers a1,…,an.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer --- the largest value of min(s1,…,sk) you can obtain.

Explanation
Test case 1: You can partition the array as [1,2,3][3,3] and obtain min(s1,s2)=min(6,6)=6.
Test case 3: You can partition the array as [−2][6,−2,−3][2,−3] and obtain min(s1,s2,s3)=min(−2,1,−1)=−2.
