You are given a positive integer NN and an array AA of size NN. There are N lists L1,L2…LN. Initially, Li=[Ai].
You can perform the following operation any number of times as long as there are at least 2 lists:

Select 2 (non-empty) lists Li and Lj (i≠j)
Append Lj to Li and remove the list Lj. Note that this means Lj cannot be chosen in any future operation.

Find the minimum number of operations required to obtain a set of lists that satisfies the following conditions:

The first element and last element of each list are equal.
The first element of all the lists is the same.

Print −1 if it is not possible to achieve this via any sequence of operations.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer: the minimum number of operations required to obtain an array of lists that satisfies the given conditions.
Print −1 if it is impossible to achieve such an array of lists.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤N≤2⋅105
1≤Ai≤N
Sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅105

Explanation
Test case 1: There is only one list [1], and it trivially satisfies the condition so no operations are required.
Test case 2: There are only 2 ways to do an operation - either take list [1] and append it to list [2] or take list [2] and append it to list [1]. In both cases, it is not possible to satisfy both given conditions at the same time. Hence, the answer is −1.
Test case 3: Here is one possible order of operations:

Select the 3rd list [2] and append it to the 1st list [1].
Then, select the 2nd list [1] and append it to the 1st list [1,2].

Finally, we are left with the single list [1,2,1] which satisfies the given conditions. It can be verified that it is impossible to do this using less than 2 operations.
