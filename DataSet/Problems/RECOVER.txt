A long time ago, a grid with N rows and N columns had mysteriously vanished. The cells of this grid contain integers 1 through N⋅N in some order. You do not know this order, but some information remains to this day: M pairs of cells with Manhattan distance 1 or 2.
You should find a grid satisfying the following conditions (or decide that it does not exist):

The cells of the grid contain all integers from 1 to N2.
For each given pair (u,v), the cells containing u and v have Manhattan distance 1 or 2.
There are no other pairs of cells with Manhattan distance 1 or 2.

If there are multiple possible solutions, you may find any one.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.
Each of the following M lines contains two space-separated integers u and v describing a pair of cells at distance 1 or 2.

Output
For each test case:

If there is no solution, print a single line containing the integer −1.
Otherwise, print N lines containing N space-separated integers each. The j-th integer on the i-th line should denote the number in the i-th row and j-th column of the grid.

Constraints

1≤T≤200
1≤N≤200
0≤M≤3⋅105
1≤u,v≤N2
u≠v
all pairs (u,v) are distinct
the sum of M over all test cases does not exceed 106

Example Input
2
2 6
1 3
1 4
1 2
3 4
3 2
4 2
3 6
3 8
3 1
3 9
3 5
3 2
8 1

Example Output
1 3
2 4
-1

Explanation
Example case 1: Note that there are many possible solutions.
Example case 2: A solution satisfying all constraints on given pairs may exist, but there would always be some other pair of cells with distance 1 or 2 too.
