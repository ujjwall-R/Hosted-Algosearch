"What do you know about happiness?" — Yoda 
Chef is happy only if three conditions hold:

Chef finished cooking a delicious meal
Chef got AC for a programming problem with an almost correct code
Chef got a new problem with a sequence of integers

Today, all three conditions are satisfied. Chef would like you to feel his happiness and provide him with a solution for this new problem with a sequence of integers. The problem is as follows.
You are given a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. You need to determine if it is possible to choose two indices ii and jj such that Ai≠AjAi≠Aj, but AAiAAi = AAjAAj. (If it was possible, Chef would be truly happy.)
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Truly Happy" if it is possible to choose required indices or "Poor Chef" otherwise.
Constraints

1≤T≤1,000
1≤N≤105
1≤Ai≤N for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (27 points): 1≤N≤1,000
Subtask #2 (73 points): original constraints

Truly Happy
Poor Chef
Poor Chef
Truly Happy


Explanation
Example case 1: Chef is truly happy because AA3=AA1 and A3≠A1.
Example case 2: There is no pair of indices which would make Chef truly happy. For instance, AA3=AA4, but A3=A4,
