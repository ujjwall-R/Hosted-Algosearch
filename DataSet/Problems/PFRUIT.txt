The chefs are making fruit salads today! There are k chefs in total, each making a different type of salad. However, the chefs have run out of fruit, so they sent m workers to pick fruit for them.
Some workers are fast, but some are really slow. Specifically, for each worker, we know two integers a and b, which mean that this worker can pick between a and b units of fruit today (inclusive). There are n groups of workers; all workers in each group have the same a,b.
The workers don't care about the number of units of fruit they pick, so they choose these numbers randomly. A worker with parameters a, b will choose an integer between a and b uniformly randomly and pick this number of units of fruit today.
If the number of units of fruit picked by all workers together at the end of the day is S, the chefs define the goodness of the day as F(S)=Sk for some reason. They would like you to find the expected value of F. It can be proven that this expected value can be written as a fraction P/Q, where P≥0 and Q>0 are coprime integers. You should calculate P⋅Q−1 modulo 998244353, where Q−1 denotes the modular inverse of Q modulo 998244353. (It is guaranteed that this inverse exists and is unique.)
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers k and m.
The second line contains a single integer n.
Each of the following n lines contains three space-separated integers A, B and C denoting a group of workers; there are C workers in this group, with a=A and b=B for each of them.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer - the value of P⋅Q−1 modulo 998244353.

Explanation
There are two workers. The first worker always picks 1 unit of fruit. The second worker can pick 1 or 2 units. If he picks 1 unit, S=2 and F=4. If he picks 2 units, S=3 and F=9. Each situation happens with probability 1/2, so the expected value is 4/2+9/2=13/2. This means P=13 and Q=2, so Q−1=499122177.
