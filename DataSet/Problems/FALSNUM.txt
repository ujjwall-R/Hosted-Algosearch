One day, Chef's friend gave him a wrong number WW containing N+1N+1 digits and said that the actual number AA is the largest possible number that can be obtained from deleting exactly one digit of W. Chef was able to find A but forgot W. 
Given A, find the smallest possible number W of length N+1 without leading 0's that is consistent with the story above. We can show that there is always at least one such W consistent with the story.
Input

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
Each test case contains a single line of input, an integer A. 

Output
For each testcase, output in a single line string representing the answer to the problem.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
0≤Ai≤9 for all valid i, where Ai denotes the i-th digit of A
A1≠0 (no leading zero)
10≤|A|≤5000, where |A| denotes the number of digits of A
