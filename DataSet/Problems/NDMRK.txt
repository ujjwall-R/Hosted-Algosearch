You are given an integer KK and a tree of size NN, rooted at node 1. In one operation, you can either select a node of the tree and color its entire subtree or create a new (uncolored) copy of the given tree. Find the minimum number of operations required so that the total number of colored nodes among all trees is exactly K.
Input

The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
For each test case, the first line contains two integers N and K, the size of the given tree and the number of nodes to be colored, respectively.
The next line contains N−1 integers p2,…,pn, where pi is the parent of node i.

Output
For each testcase, output a single integer: the minimum number of operations required to color exactly K total nodes.
Constraints

1≤T≤400
1≤N≤5⋅104
1≤K≤103
1≤pi≤N
The input describes a valid tree rooted at node 1
The sum of N⋅K over all test cases does not exceed 107

Subtasks

Subtask 1 (10 points): The tree is a simple path
Subtask 2 (35 points): 1≤N,K≤200 and the sum of N⋅K does not exceed 4⋅104
Subtask 3 (55 points): Original constraints

Sample Input
2
3 5
1 1
4 6
1 2 2

Sample Output
4
3

Explanation
For the first test case:

Operation 1: The subtree of node 1 is colored (coloring a total of 3 nodes).
Operation 2: A new copy of tree is generated.
Operation 3: The subtree of node 2 of the new tree is colored.
Operation 4: The subtree of node 3 of the new tree is colored.

For the second test case:

Operation 1: The subtree of node 2 is colored (coloring a total of 3 nodes).
Operation 2: A new copy of tree is generated.
Operation 3: The subtree of node 2 is colored (coloring a total of 3 more nodes).
