Mohammed has a wire, its length is nn. He wants to cut the wire in a way that fulfils the following two conditions:

After the cutting each wire piece should have length aa, bb or c.
After the cutting the number of wire pieces should be maximum.

Help Mohammed and find the number of wire pieces after the required cutting.
Input

The first and the only line contains four space-separated integers n, a, b and c (1 ≤ n, a, b, c ≤ 4000) — the length of the original wire and the acceptable lengths of the wire pieces after the cutting, correspondingly. The numbers a, b and c can coincide.

Output
Print a single number — the maximum possible number of wire pieces. It is guaranteed that at least one correct wire cutting exists.
Sample Inputs
5 5 3 2

7 5 5 2

Sample Outputs
 2

 2

Note

In the first example Mohammed can cut the wire in such way: the first piece has length 2, the second piece has length 3.
In the second example Mohammed can cut the wire in such way: the first piece has length 5, the second piece has length 2.
