 Chef has an array A consisting of N non-negative integers. Initially, all the elements are zero. Assume 1-based indexing. Chef is given two positive integers L and R. (L <= R) Chef has to execute Q number of queries on the array A. These queries can be of the following two types:

1 x y (1 ≤ x ≤ n) - Replace the value of xth array element by y.
 
2 l r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) - Return the number of subarrays [a , b] that lies in subarray [l , r] such that the value of the maximum array element in that subarray is atleast L and atmost R.
 
         (A subarray [a , b] lies in a subarray [l , r] if and only if a >= l and b <= r)
 
Since, Chef couldn't solve this task, can you please help him solve this task?

Input
The first line contains four space separated positive integers N, Q, L and R denoting the total number of elements in an array, total number of queries, value of L, and value of R respectively.  
Each of the next Q lines contains one of the two queries described above.
Output
For each query of type 2, print the required answer in a new line.
Constraints
1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 5 * 10^5
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 10^9 
1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ N 
1 ≤ x ≤ N 
1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9
Subtasks
Subtask #1 (10 points) : 1 ≤ N , Q ≤ 100 
Subtask #2 (15 points) : 1 ≤ N , Q ≤ 5000 
Subtask #3 (27 points) : 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^4 
Subtask #4 (48 points) : Original Constraints

Explanation
Query 1.
 A = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0} 

After replacing value of 1st element by 2,
A = {2, 0, 0, 0, 0} 
Query 2.
A = {2, 0, 0, 0, 0}

All the subarrays that lies in a subarray [1 , 5] whose maximum value is atleast 1 and atmost 10 are -
 [1 , 1], [1 , 2], [1 , 3], [1 , 4] and [1 , 5]. Thus the answer is 5.

Query 3.
A = {2, 0, 0, 0, 0}
After replacing value of 3rd element by 11, 
A = {2, 0, 11, 0, 0}
 
Query 4.
A = {2, 0, 11, 0, 0}  
After replacing value of 4th element by 3, 
A = {2, 0, 11, 3, 0}

Query 5.
A = {2, 0, 11, 3, 0}
All the subarrays that lies in a subarray [3 , 5] whose maximum value is atleast 1 and atmost 10 are -
 [4 , 4] and [4 , 5]. Thus the answer is 2.


Query 6.
A = {2, 0, 11, 3, 0}
All the subarrays that lies in a subarray [1 , 5] whose maximum value is atleast 1 and atmost 10 are -
 [1 , 1], [1 , 2], [4 , 4] and [4 , 5]. Thus the answer is 4.
