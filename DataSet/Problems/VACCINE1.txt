Increasing COVID cases have created panic amongst the people of Chefland, so the government is starting to push for production of a vaccine. It has to report to the media about the exact date when vaccines will be available.
There are two companies which are producing vaccines for COVID. Company A starts producing vaccines on day D1 and it can produce V1 vaccines per day. Company B starts producing vaccines on day D2 and it can produce V2 vaccines per day. Currently, we are on day 1.
We need a total of P vaccines. How many days are required to produce enough vaccines? Formally, find the smallest integer d such that we have enough vaccines at the end of the day d.
Input

The first and only line of the input contains five space-separated integers D1, V1, D2, V2 and P.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest required number of days.
Constraints

1≤D1,V1,D2,V2≤100
1≤P≤1,000

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (30 points): D1=D2
Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints
Example Input 1
1 2 1 3 14

Example Output 1
3

Explanation
Since D1=D2=1, we can produce V1+V2=5 vaccines per day. In 3 days, we produce 15 vaccines, which satisfies our requirement of 14 vaccines.
Example Input 2
5 4 2 10 100

Example Output 2
9

Explanation
There are 0 vaccines produced on the first day, 10 vaccines produced on each of days 2, 3 and 4, and 14 vaccines produced on the fifth and each subsequent day. In 9 days, it makes a total of 0+10⋅3+14⋅5=100 vaccines.
