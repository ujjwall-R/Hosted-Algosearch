For a given positive integer N find the number of all positive integers X such that N divides X and the number of all positive divisors of X (including 1 and X) is equal to N. If there exist infinitely many such numbers print -1.

Input
 The first line contains a single positive integer T <= 100, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains a positive integer N , where N <= 10^18.

Output
 For each test case, output a single line containing the answer for the corresponding test case.

Example
Input:
3
6
113
144

Output:
2
1
-1

Explanation
In the first test case only numbers 12 and 18 have 6 divisors and are divisible by 6.

In the second test case the only number is 113^112.

In the third test case there are infinitely many of them.
