Beeds Arranging game is described by a string of length nn consisting of characters "." (empty space)  and  "*" (beed). In one move you can shift beed to one unit left or one unit right, only if the corresponding place existsexists andand is empty. The game ends up as soon as the beeds are lined up, that is, there should not exist any empty cells between any beeds.
Jaskaran is finding this game a bit challenging and needs your help. For a game, determine the minimum number of moves you need to make complete that game. 
Input
The first line contains a single integer t(1≤t≤104). Then t test cases follow. 
The first line of each test case contains one integer n (1≤si≤106)
The second line of each test case contains a string of length n, consisting of the characters "." (empty space) and "*" (beed) — the description of the game.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n  over all the test cases does not exceed106.

Output
For each test case output the minimum number of moves you need to make to complete the game.

Constraints
