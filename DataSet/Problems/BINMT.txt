Shahid's friend has given him a problem to solve but he is busy with his final exam. So he asked you to solve the problem.
The problem is that you have been given a N*N matrix A containing only 0 and 1. Your task is to AND every element of the matrix with the elements of its 
corresponding row and column and output the resulting matrix.

Input

First line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
First line of each test case contains a integer N, the size of each side of the matrix.
N lines follow. The ith(1 <= i <= N) of these lines contain N space-separated integers the jth(1 <= j <= N) of which is the element A[i][j].


Output
For each test case, print the final matrix after performing the required task.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
0 ≤ A[i][j] ≤ 1


Example Input
1
3
1 1 0 
1 1 1 
1 1 1


Example Output
0 0 0 
1 1 0 
1 1 0
