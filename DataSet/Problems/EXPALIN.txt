You are given a binary string S of N bits. The bits in the string are indexed starting from 1. S[i] denotes the ith bit of S.


Let's say that a sequence i1, i2, …, iK(1 ≤ K; 1 ≤ i1 < i2 < … < iK ≤ N) produces a palindrome when applied to S, if the string S[i1] S[i2] … S[ik] is a palindrome (that is, reads the same backward or forward).

 
In addition, a sequence i1, i2, …, iK(1 ≤ K; 1 ≤ i1 < i2 < … < iK ≤ N) is said to be exponential, if ij + 1 = p * ij for each integer 1 ≤ j < K and for some integer p > 1. Note, that a sequence of one element is always exponential.

Your task is to count the number of exponential sequences that produce a palindrome when applied to S.
Input
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The only line of description for each test case contains a binary string S of N bits.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the number of exponential sequences that produce a palindrome.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
Subtask 1(20 points): 1 ≤ N ≤ 20
Subtask 2(30 points): 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
Subtask 3(50 points): 1 ≤ N ≤ 5 × 105

Note

The first test of the first subtask is the example test. It's made for you to make sure that your solution produces the same verdict both on your machine and our server.

Time Limits

Time limit for the first and the second subtasks is 3s. Time limit for the third subtask is 6s.
