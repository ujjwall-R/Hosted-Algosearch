Motu has KK boxes and every box is empty at time tt == 0. Now Patlu gave him coins at some T instants of time (1,2,3...T) and asked him to put one coin in each box from box L to R. Patlu make a record of the data and also asked Motu to do the same. Now he asked Motu some queries and asked him to tell the number of coins present in a box X from time t1 to time t2 i.e. number of additional coins that are added to the box X from [t1,t2) .
Input:

First line of the input contains two integer, T and Q 
Next T lines contains two integers L , R, where coins are put from box L to box R.
Next Q lines contains three integers t1 , t2 , X 

Output:
For each query , output in a single line answer, the number of coins present in a box X from time instant t1 to t2. i.e [t1,t2).
Constraints

1≤T≤105
2≤Q≤105
1≤K≤109
1≤t1<t2≤T
1≤X≤K
1≤L≤R≤K 

Sample Input:
 4 3
 1 3
 3 5
 1 5
 1 2
 2 4 4
 1 2 3
 1 4 1

Sample Output:
 2
 1
 2

EXPLANATION:

Query 1: In time 2 to 4, additional  2 coins are added to box 4.
At instant 2 : 1 coin is added in box 4.
At instant 3 : 1 coin is added in box 4.
So answer is 2.
Query 2: In time 1 to 2, additional  1 coin is added to box 3
 At instant 1:  1 coin is added in box 3.
 So answer is 1.
Query 3: In time 1 to 4, additional 2 coins are added to box 1
 At instant 1: 1 coin is added in box 1. 
 At instant 2: no coin is added in box 1. 
 At instant 3: 1 coin is added in box 1. 
 So answer is 2.
