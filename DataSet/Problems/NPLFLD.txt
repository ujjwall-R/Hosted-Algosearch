Given a n*n grid with every cell in it consisting of number 1,2 or 3. A person standing at cell (a,b) can go to (c,d) only if (c-a)+(d-b)=1 and c>=a and d>=b.
The cost of a walk is the product of all the numbers on the cells visited in that walk.
Now you have to answer q queries of the form: for each given x, y ->
You start at (1,1) and end your walk in the cell (n,n), now you want to know if there is a walk such that its cost is equal to 2x*3y.


Input

First line will contain n the dimension of the grid.
Next n ines contain n values each denoting the values in the jth cell of the ith row.
Next line contains an integer q no of queries.
Next q lines contains 2 integers x and y denoting the query.

Output
For every query print "YES"(without quotes) if there is a walk with cost 2x*3y and "NO" otherwise.
Constraints

1 <= n <= 18
1 <= Ai,j <= 3
1 <= q <= 1000
1 <= x,y <= 2*n-1

Example
Input:
5
1 2 2 3 1
1 1 1 2 3
1 2 3 1 2
1 2 2 2 2
3 3 3 3 3
1
6 1

Output:
YES
