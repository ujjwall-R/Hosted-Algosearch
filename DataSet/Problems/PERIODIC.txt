Let's define a periodic infinite sequence SS (00-indexed) with period KK using the formula Si=(i%K)+1.
Chef has found a sequence of positive integers A with length N buried underground. He suspects that it is a contiguous subsequence of some periodic sequence. Unfortunately, some elements of A are unreadable. Can you tell Chef the longest possible period K of an infinite periodic sequence which contains A (after suitably filling in the unreadable elements) as a contiguous subsequence?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N. 
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN. Unreadable elements are denoted by −1.

Output
For each test case, print a single line.

If the period can be arbitrarily large, this line should contain a single string "inf".
Otherwise, if A cannot be a contiguous subsequence of a periodic sequence, it should contain a single string "impossible".
Otherwise, it should contain a single integer — the maximum possible period.

Constraints

1≤T≤100
2≤N≤105
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106
for each valid i, 1≤Ai≤106 or Ai=−1

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (50 points):

2≤N≤1,000
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 10,000

Subtask #2 (50 points): original constraints
