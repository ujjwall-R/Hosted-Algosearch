For a string S, let's define a function F(S) as the minimum number of blocks consisting of consecutive identical characters in S. In other words, F(S) is equal to 1 plus the number of valid indices i such that Si ≠ Si+1.
You are given two strings A and B with lengths N and M respectively. You should merge these two strings into one string C with length N+M. Specifically, each character of C should come either from A or B; all characters from A should be in the same relative order in C as in A and all characters from B should be in the same relative order in C as in B.
Compute the minimum possible value of F(C).
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.
The second line contains a single string A with length N.
The third line contains a single string B with length M.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum possible value of F(C).
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N, M ≤ 5,000
1 ≤ sum of N in all test cases ≤ 5,000
1 ≤ sum of M in all test cases ≤ 5,000
strings A, B consist only of lowercase English letters

Subtasks

Subtask 1 (10 points): 1 ≤ T, N, M ≤ 10


Subtask 2 (20 points): the characters of A and B are sorted in non-decreasing order


Subtask 3 (70 points): original constraints
