Chef has an array a1,…,an of n elements. He wants you to answer queries of the following type: 
Compute f(L,R), where f(L,R)=R∑i=LR∑j=igcd(ai,ai+1,…aj). In other words, we want to compute the sum of the greatest common divisors over all subarrays of some range [L,R]. 
Help Chef answer q queries of the described type. 
Input:
The first line contains two integers n and q - the size of the array and the number of queries.
The second line contains n integers a1,…,an.
Each of the following q lines contains two integers l, r.
The queries are encrypted. Let the answer to the previous query be x (or 0 if there is none). The query is decrypted as follows: L=((l+x)modn)+1 and R=((r+x)modn)+1.
Output:
Print q integers - the answer to each query modulo 109+7.
Constraints
1≤n≤2⋅105
1≤q≤106
1≤ai≤109
0≤l,r≤n
