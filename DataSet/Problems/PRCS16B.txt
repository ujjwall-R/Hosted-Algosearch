Given two equally sized arrays A and B of size N. A is empty and B has some values. You need to fill A with an element X such that X belongs to B.
The only operations allowed are :


Copy B[i] to A[i].
Cyclic shift B by 1 to the the right.

You need to minimize the number of operations.

Input
The first line contains a integer N, the number of elements.The next line contains N space separated integers, where the ith integer denotes B[i].
 
Output
Output a single integer, the minimum number of operations.
 
Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 106
1 ≤ B[i] ≤ 105

 
Example
Case 1:
Input:
3
1 2 3
Output:
5


Case 2:
Input:
6
1 1 2 2 3 3
Output:
10

 
Explanation
Example case 1. We can have 5 steps as : { fill first element, shift, fill second element, shift, fill third element}

A = [ _ _ _ ] , B = [1,2,3]
After step 1, A = [1 _ _ ] , B = [1,2,3]
After step 2, A = [1 _ _ ] , B = [3,1,2]
After step 3, A = [1 1 _ ] , B = [3,1,2]
After step 4, A = [1 1 _ ] , B = [2,3,1]
After step 5, A = [1 1 1 ] , B = [2,3,1]


 Input/Output data is large, Use Fast I/O
