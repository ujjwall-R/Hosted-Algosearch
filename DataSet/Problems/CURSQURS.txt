Chef has an integer sequence A1,A2,…,AN and Chefina has an integer sequence B1,B2,…,BM. Since Chef is a genius, he always keeps himself busy with some tasks. One day, Chef took the sequences A and B and constructed a matrix C with N rows (numbered 1 through N) and M columns (numbered 1 through M) such that for each valid i and j, the value in row i and column j is Ci,j=Ai⊕Bj, where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operator.
Chefina is curious about this matrix, but she does not have a lot of time, so she asked Chef to tell her some information about it. For each integer L from 1 to max(N,M) inclusive:

For all integers X and Y such that 1≤X,Y≤L, consider all submatrices of C with X rows and Y columns.
The beauty of a submatrix is defined as its size (the number of elements in it) multiplied by the XOR of all elements in the submatrix.
Chef should find the sum of beauties of all these submatrices modulo 1,000,000,007.

Note: The definition of the submatrix is used according to here.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
The third line contains M space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BM.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing max(N,M) space-separated integers ― the sums of beauties for L=1,2,…,max(N,M), modulo 1,000,000,007.
Constraints

1≤T≤1,000
1≤N,M≤65,000
0≤Ai≤106 for each valid i
0≤Bi≤106 for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 65,000
the sum of M over all test cases does not exceed 65,000

Explanation
Example case 1: The matrix C is
5 2 3 0
6 1 0 3
7 0 1 2

For L=1, the sum of beauties is (5+2+3+0+6+1+0+3+7+0+1+2)⋅1=30. For L=2, the sum of beauties is (5+2+3+0+6+1+0+3+7+0+1+2)⋅1+(7+1+3+7+1+3+7+1+3)⋅2+(3+1+3+1+3+1+3+1)⋅2+(0+0+0+0+0+0)⋅4=128.
