You’re given a tree with N nodes (where each node i has a value Ai) and Q queries in the form u v. The answer to each query is the XOR of value of nodes on the shortest path from node u to v.
Input

First line will contains a single integer T, number of test cases.
First line of each test case contains two space-separated integers - N and Q
Second line of each test case contains N space separated integers, the ith of which is Ai.
The next N−1 lines contains two space separated integers - u and v - denoting that there is an edge from u to v and vice-versa
The next Q lines each contain two space separated integers u and v, denoting a query.

Output
For each query, output the answer on a new line. 
Constraints

1≤T≤10
3≤N≤105
1≤Q≤105
1≤Ai≤108

Sample Input
1
5 2
1 2 3 4 5
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
3 5
4 5

Sample Output
5
3

EXPLANATION:
The path for (3,5) is :
3 → 1 → 2 → 5; therefore, the answer for the query is 5. 
The path for (4,5) is :
4 → 2 → 5; therefore, the answer for the query is 3.
