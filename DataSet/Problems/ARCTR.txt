Archi is a small boy from Uzhlyandia. For Chef's birthday, he prepared a tree with NN vertices (numbered 11 through N). Each edge in this tree has a certain length.
There are M speedsters on the tree, numbered 1 through M. For each valid i, speedster number i starts at time ti from vertex number ui and runs straight to vertex number vi with constant velocity si. Before time ti, the speedster is not considered to be present in the tree.
Chef is interested in the following question: for each vertex, what is the smallest time when a speedster is present at this vertex?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
Each of the next N−1 lines contains three space-separated integers u, v and w denoting an edge between vertices u and v with length w.
The next line contains a single integer M.
For each valid i, the i-th of the next M lines contains four space-separated integers ui, vi, ti and si describing the i-th speedster.

Output
For each test case, print N lines. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines should contain a single real number — the minimum time when the i-th vertex is visited by a speedster, or −1 if it is never visited. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10−6.
Constraints
