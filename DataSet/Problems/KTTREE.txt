Chef opened a chain of restaurants in Chefland and invited his KK friends (numbered 11 through K) to move there.
Chefland can be represented by a tree with N vertices (numbered 1 through N). For each valid i, the i-th vertex has a type ci. There are K+1 types of vertices: ci=0 means that there is a restaurant in vertex i, while 1≤ci≤K means that there is a house with a colour ci in vertex i.
For each valid i, the i-th friend of Chef agrees to move to Chefland only if he will live in a house of colour i. Friends want to meet frequently, so Chef needs to choose houses for his friends in such a way that for each pair of friends, there is at least one restaurant on the unique simple path between their houses.
Find the number of ways to choose houses for all friends. Formally, you have to find the number of sequences of vertices (v1,v2,…,vK) such that:

for each i (1≤i≤K), cvi=i
for each i and j (1≤i<j≤K), there is at least one vertex with type 0 on the path between vi and vj

Since the number of these sequences could be large, compute it modulo 998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers c1,c2,…,cN.
Each of the next N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting that vertices u and v are connected by an edge.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of ways to choose houses modulo 998,244,353.
