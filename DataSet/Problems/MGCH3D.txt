Today, you finally have a chance to compete with a famous coder like Vasia and prove your mettle.
While he likes the real world as well, his adventures in 3D computer puzzles make him the undisputed King of the subject. Until now, that is!
Vasia has N distinct points in 3 dimensional space and he is going to ask you to find the following sum Q times.

Where A,B,C and D are some evil integers chosen by Vasia, and their values vary for each summation query.
Input

First line contains two integers N and Q. N is number of points, and Q is number of queries.
The next N lines contain integer point coordinates Xi, Yi, Zi.
The last Q lines contain a query each in the form of 4 integers A, B, C, D.
Note that all the integers in a single line are separated by single spaces.

Output
For each query, output a single line containing the sum accurate up to 10-6.
Constraints

2 ≤ N ≤ 777777
1 ≤ Q ≤ 77
1 ≤ Xi, Yi, Zi ≤ 77
1 ≤ Ai, Bi, Ci ≤ 77
1 ≤ Di ≤ 7777
P.S. I hope the digit "7" brings you luck :)
