After learning about the bitwise AND operation, Ridbit challenged Ashishgup to solve the following problem.
Let's denote the bitwise AND of one or more integers a1,a2,…,aka1,a2,…,ak by AND(a1,a2,…,ak)AND(a1,a2,…,ak). For example, AND(7,3,5)=1AND(7,3,5)=1. In particular, for an integer x, AND(x)=x.
Given a sequence of integers A1,A2,…,AN, Ridbit wants Ashishgup to reorder its elements (possibly leaving the sequence unchanged) in such a way that in the resulting sequence A, the sum of the values of bitwise AND for all prefixes of the sequence, i.e. ∑Ni=1AND(A1,A2,…Ai), is maximum possible.
Find the maximum value of this sum.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum possible value of the sum of values of bitwise AND for all prefixes.
Constraints

1≤T≤1,000
1≤N≤220
0≤Ai<N for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 220

Explanation
Example case 1: The optimal order is [2,1,0]. Then, AND(2)+AND(2,1)+AND(2,1,0)=2+0+0=2.
Example case 2: The optimal order is [3,1,1,2]. Then, AND(3)+AND(3,1)+AND(3,1,1)+AND(3,1,1,2)=3+1+1+0=5.
