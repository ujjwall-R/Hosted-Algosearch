Problem description.
There are N shops in a straight line some where in Mirzapur each of them selling same type of chocolate. 
Each shops have their own price of chocolate . Formally , i-th shop sells A[i] number of chocolates in exchange of 1 coin . Also each shop will give B[i] number of chocolates for free to any customer that buys chocolates from their shop .

Chef likes chocolates very much so he regularly buys chocolates from any one shopkeeper who will give him maximum number of chocolates . 
Chef also likes playing with intervals . So each time Chef will have x number of coins in his pocket and two integers L and R . Chef will look at every shop that lies between L and R and will buy chocolates from that shop which will give him maximum number of chocolates for x coins .

Also the position of shops are changing with time . 
 
More formally there are Q actions of two types that are happening in a sequence. 
1 i j i-th shop is shifted after j-th shop. 
2 L R x                 Chef arrives at market to buy chocolates with x coins in his pocket along with two integers L and R as described above.   
  Note that there are only 10% queries of type 1 .

Input:

First line will contain N, number of shops.
Next N lines contains two space separated integers A[i] and B[i] as described above
Next line contain one integer Q number of queries. 
Next Q line will contain queries of either of two types : 1) 1 i j   ,     2) 2 L R x 


Output:
Print the answer for each query of type two in a new line. 
Constraints
1≤N≤50000
 1≤A[i],B[i]≤105
 1≤Q≤105
 1≤i≤j≤N
 1≤L≤R≤N
 1≤x≤105
Sample Input:
5     
2 2  
4 5
1 3
3 6
7 1
3
2 2 3 3
1 2 4
2 2 3 3
Sample Output:
17 
15 
EXPLANATION:
Before shifting shops in range [2,3] are (4,5)and(1,3) out of which 1-st shop will give maximum chocolate i.e. 4∗3+5=17. 
After shifting sequence of shop will be as below : 
2 2  
1 3
3 6
4 5
7 1
 Therefore  shops in range [2,3] are (1,3)and(3,6) out of which 2-nd shop will give maximum chocolate i.e. 3∗3+6=15.
