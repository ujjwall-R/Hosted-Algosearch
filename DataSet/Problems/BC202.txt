Given a sorted array arr, remove the duplicates from arr such that each element appears only once and display the new array.
Input:

The first line contains T, the number of test cases. Then the T test cases follow. 
Each test case contains 2 lines of input:


The first line contains n, the size of array arr.
The second line contains n space separated elements of array arr.

Output:
For each test case, output in a single line, the new array. The elements of the array should be separated by space. Your output format should match with that given in the sample output.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
1≤n≤104
−105≤arr[i]≤105

Sample Input:
2
3
1 1 2
10
0 0 1 1 1 2 2 3 3 4   
Sample Output:
1 2
0 1 2 3 4   
EXPLANATION:

Given arr = [1,1,2]. Here 1 is repeated, so after deleting 1 the modified array will be [1,2].
Given arr = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]. After deleting the repeated integers, the modified array will be [0,1,2,3,4].
