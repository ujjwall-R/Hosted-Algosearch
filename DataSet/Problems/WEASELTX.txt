A tree is an undirected graph in which each pair of vertices is connected to each other by exactly one path. Weasel has a tree with N nodes. The indexing of the nodes is 0-based and the tree is rooted at node 0. Every node i has an initial value X0i.
Every day d > 0, he performs the following operations, starting from the root:

Weasel computes Xdu as the bitwise-xor sum of all the values Xd − 1v for a node v in u's subtree.
He recursively proceeds to perform the operation for every child of u.


For Q values of Δ, Weasel wants to compute XΔ0.
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers N and Q.
Each of the following N − 1 lines contains two integers, u and v, an edge in the tree.
On the following line there are N integers, representing the X0 array.
Each of the next Q lines contains values for Δ as noted in the statement.
Output
You should print Q lines, each containing XΔ0.
Constraints

1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 2 * 105
0 ≤ X0i ≤ 1018 for every 0 ≤ i ≤ N − 1.
0 ≤ Δ ≤ 1018
0 ≤ u, v ≤ N − 1

Explanation
Initially X0 = [1, 5, 8, 7].
Weasel performs his operation on node 0:
 X10 = X00 xor X01 xor X02 xor X03 = 1 xor 5 xor 8 xor 7 = 11. 
X11 = X01 xor X02  = 5 xor 8 = 13.

X12 and X13 remain equal to X02, respectively X03.
