Chef has n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an. He defined the following function 
f(k) = (a1k + a2k + ... + ank) mod (109 + 7) over them.


Chef knows the values f(1), f(2), ..., f(n), but he has forgotten the values a1, a2, ..., an.


Now Chef wants to evaluate the function f over some integers (total Q  of them), can you please help him in this?

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow.
Each test case consists of three lines.
The first line contains two space separated integers n and Q.
The second line contains n space separated integers - the values of f(1), f(2), ..., f(n).
The third line contains Q space separated integers x1, x2, ..., xq, where xi denotes the number in the i-th query.
Output

For each test case, print a single line containing Q space separate integers denoting  the values of f(x1), f(x2), ..., f(xq).
Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 300
1 ≤ Q ≤ 30
0 ≤ f(i) < 109 + 7
n < xi ≤ 1018
It is guaranteed that given information is enough to restore the function f and that there exist exactly one such function.

Explanation

Test case 1. The initial 4 numbers Chef has are 1, 2, 0, 1, so, the function f was defined as follows: f(k) = (1k + 2k + 0k + 1k) mod (109 + 7) = (2k + 2) mod (109 + 7).

So, the values given in the input are:

f(1) = (21 + 2) mod (109 + 7) = 4
f(2) = (22 + 2) mod (109 + 7) = 6
f(3) = (23 + 2) mod (109 + 7) = 10
f(4) = (24 + 2) mod (109 + 7) = 18




And the values Chef asked you to calculate are:

f(5) = (25 + 2) mod (109 + 7) = 34
f(6) = (26 + 2) mod (109 + 7) = 66
f(30) = (230 + 2) mod (109 + 7) = 1073741826  mod (109 + 7) = 73741819
