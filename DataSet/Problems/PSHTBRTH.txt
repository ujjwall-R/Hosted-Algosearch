A little boy Pishty lives in Khust - an ancient town in the best country of the world - Uzhlyandia
(also Khust is a wonderful town with their own castle and smart bears, but this is not relevant for us). And he is celebrating his birthday today!

Citizens of Uzhlyandia love two things : cakes and  goulash  , but Pishty prefer cakes.
So his friend Lotsy decided to buy N  cakes, because a friend's birthday must be the best day of his life!

A cake can be thought of as a 4 × 4 square matrix, and in each cell of the matrix no more than 1 candle can be placed.

The two boys like to play a game, in which they extinguish candles.

They play in turns, with the birthday boy Pishty taking the first turn. In each turn, one of the boys picks a cake with burning candles on it, chooses a rectangle (ie. a  submatrix ) which has burning candles in all its cells, and extinguishes all those candles. If a boy can't make a move, he loses. You should assume that they play optimally. No one likes to lose a game, even to their best friend!


Because Pishty and Lotsy are best friends, Lotsy wants to buy the best collection of cakes, and so he has M queries to make to the Chef. There are 2 types of queries :

 to find the winner in the game if it is played with only the cakes in the range [L; R] 
 to change a matrix, denoting a cake at some position 

Help Chef answer all of Lotsy's queries, and make Pishty's birthday the best birthday in the world!
Input
 The first line contains one integer  T , denoting the number of test cases. Then T test case descriptions follow.
The first line of the each description contains two integers  N  and
 M, denoting the number of cakes and the number of queries respectively.

The following 5 × N lines contain information about the N cake-denoting matrices (four lines of strings of four chars (without spaces), followed by an empty line). An element of a matrix equals 1 if there is a burning candle and 0 if there isn't anything.
Then the queries follow in one of the following formats:

  1 L R  - to find the winner in the game where only the caked in the range [L; R] are used.
 2 pos matrix  -  to change the cake-denoting matrix at position pos to matrix
Here, 2 pos will be on the first line and matrix  will be described in the next four lines. each of which will be a string of four chars, without spaces in between. There will be no empty line after these four lines.




Output
For each query of first type output a single line containing a string "Pishty", if Pishty will win, or "Lotsy" otherwise.
