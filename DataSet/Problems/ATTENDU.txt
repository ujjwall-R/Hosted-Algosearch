A semester in Chef's University has 120120 working days. The University's requirement is that a student should be present for at least 75%75% of the working days in the semester. If not, the student is failed.
Chef has been taking a lot of holidays, and is now concerned whether he can pass the attendance requirement or not. NN working days have already passed, and you are given NN bits - B1B1, B2B2, …, BNBN. BiBi = 00 denotes that Chef was absent on the ithith day, and BiBi = 11 denotes that Chef was present on that day.
Can Chef hope to pass the requirement by the end of the semester?
Input:

First line will contain TT, the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains two lines of input.
The first line of each testcase contains a single integer, NN, the number of days till now.
The second line of each testcase contains a string BB of length NN where BiBi represents the status of the ithith day.

Output:
For each testcase, output the answer in a single line - "YES" if Chef can pass the attendance requirement and "NO" if not.

Explanation
For Case 1, even if Chef attends all the remaining 70 days, he'll only have an attendance percentage of 70/120 = 58.33% which is less than 75%.
For Case 2, maximum attendance possible is 79.167% which is more than 75%.
For Case 3, maximum attendance possible is 99.167% which is more than 75%.
