You are given an array A1,A2,…,AN and an integer K. For each subarray S=[Al,Al+1,…,Ar] (1≤l≤r≤N):

Let's define an array B as S concatenated with itself m times, where m is the smallest integer such that m(r−l+1)≥K.
Next, let's sort B and define X=BK, i.e. as a K-th smallest element of B. Note that |B|≥K.
Then, let's define F as the number of occurrences of X in S.
The subarray S is beautiful if F occurs in S at least once.

Find the number of beautiful subarrays of A. Two subarrays Al,Al+1,…,Ar and Ap,Ap+1,…,Aq are different if l≠p or r≠q.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K. 
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the number of beautiful subarrays.

Explanation
Example case 1: There are six subarrays of A: [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [2,3], [1,2,3]. The corresponding arrays B are [1,1,1], [2,2,2], [3,3,3], [1,2,1,2], [2,3,2,3], [1,2,3].
Three of the subarrays are beautiful: [1], [1,2] and [1,2,3]. For these subarrays, X is 1, 2 and 3 respectively (for example, for S=[1,2], B=[1,2,1,2] is sorted to [1,1,2,2] and X=2 is the 3-rd element). Then, F=1 for each of these subarrays, and each of these subarrays contains 1.
