Guruji wants to explain the rahasya of satyug project to Gaitonde. But to understand this project Gaitonde needs to solve a problem.
The problem describes there are q queries each query contains integer n. String s should be obtained by appending each integer 1 to n  .
 (if n=10 ,then s=12345678910) . Gaitonde have to find the sum of nth digit of string s  in each queries.
Since Gaitonde is not good at problem-solving.So he gave you to solve this problem for him.
Input
The first line contains only integer q - number of queries ,then next q line contains integer n.
Output
Print the sum of integer obtained in each queries.
Constraints

1≤q≤104
1≤n≤104

Subtasks

(30points)1≤q≤100,1≤n≤103
(70points) Original constraints 

Sample Input
   2
   11
   12

Sample Output
   1

Explanation
In first query n=11(s=1234567891011) 11th digit of s is 0 and second query n=12(s=123456789101112) 12th digit of s is 1 .So final sum is 0+1=1.
