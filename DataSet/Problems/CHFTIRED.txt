Oh, these difficult contests… In each contest, there are so many hard tasks Chef cannot solve. However, he knows that he can only become a successful coder if he works hard. Fortunately, he has a problem in mind for training.
You are given two positive integers aa and bb. You may apply the following magical operation any number of times (including zero):

choose an arbitrary positive integer dd
perform exactly one of the following actions:
add d to a, add d−1 to b
add d−1 to a, add d to b

Chef is asking you to find out if it is possible to obtain a=b. Help him!
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers a and b. 

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to obtain a=b or "NO" if it is impossible.
Constraints

1≤T≤1,000
1≤a,b≤109

                        Sample Output 1
                        





YES


Explanation
Example case 1: One possible strategy for Chef is:

choose d=10, add d−1=9 to a and d=10 to b; after this operation, a=14 and b=17
choose d=10, add d=10 to a and d−1=9 to b; afterwards, a=24 and b=26
choose d=9, add d=9 to a and d−1=8 to b; afterwards, a=33 and b=34
choose d=9, add d to a and d−1 to b; finally, we have a=b=42
