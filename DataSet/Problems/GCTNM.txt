As the name of our college "Government College of Engineering & Textile Technology Berhampore" is too long, many students usually misspell the name.
Hence our college has decided to reject any application, if more than 50% characters of any word is wrong.
You need to calculate if a application will be accepted or rejected.
Note : It is guaranteed that each word in input consists of equal no. of characters as college name. Also, They are not case sensitive.
Input:

First line contains TT no. of test cases
for every test case, a line containing the name written in the application.  

Output:
For every test case print acceptaccept  or rejectreject in new line
Constraints

1≤T≤50

Sample Input:
3
government college of engineering & textile technology berhampore
Government collage of Enjineering & taxtile tachnology berhampure
government college of engineering & textile technology Baharampor

Sample Output:
accept
accept
reject

EXPLANATION:
First case, every word are same so accepted.
Second case, in 2nd word 1 out of 7 characters mismatch. Hence passed. Again, in 4th, 6th and 7th, 8th word 1,1,1,2 out of 11, 8, 10,10 mismatched ( < 50% ). Hence accepted
In third case, 9 character mismatch from berhampore ( total 10 chars ). So, more than 50% mismatch ( 9 >5 ) hence reject
