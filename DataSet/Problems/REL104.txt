Mr.D took her girlfriend on a date. He recently got placed so he wanted to give her so many gifts as he promised. He offered her n gifts with a condition that she must choose one gift from 4 consecutive gifts. Now our job is to find minimum cost that Mr.D must have to pay to buy those gifts.

Input

First line contains T, the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one integer N, number of gifts.
Next line contains N integer separated by space, each integer denotes the cost of ith gift. 

Output

For each test case print the required answer stated in the problem.

Constraints

1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 2 x 105
1 <= Cost of Gift <= 109

Example
Input:
2
4
1 2 3 4
7
2 2 3 6 7 1 4

Output:
1
4

Explanation
For second test case, divide the array in consecutive subarray of length 4:
2 2 3 6
2 3 6 7
3 6 7 1
6 7 1 4

Now select 3rd gift having cost 3 from first subarray.
New subarray after selecting this gift:

2 2 _ 6
2 _ 6 7
_ 6 7 1 
6 7 1 4

Now since she had selected gift with cost 3, one gift had been selected from first three 
subarray because cost 3 is common to first three subarray. Now, they are left with last subarray. 
So, she selects the gift with cost 1.

So, the total cost of gifts is 4 which is minimum of all other possible scenario.
