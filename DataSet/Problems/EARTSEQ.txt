For a set of positive integers S, let's define gcd(S) as the greatest integer which divides each element of S. If gcd(S)=1, the set S is called coprime. For example, the set {7,12,15} is coprime, but {6,12,15} is not coprime, since every element of this set is divisible by 3.
Your task is to find an integer sequence A0,A1,…,AN−1 such that:

for each valid i, 1≤Ai≤109
A0,A1,…,AN−1 are pairwise distinct
for each valid i, the set {Ai,A(i+1)%N} is not coprime (% denotes the modulo operator)
for each valid i, the set {Ai,A(i+1)%N,A(i+2)%N} is coprime

It is possible that there is no solution. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N.

Output
For each test case:

If there is no solution, print a single line containing the integer −1.
Otherwise, print a single line containing N space-separated integers A0,A1,…,AN−1.

Constraints

1≤T≤1,000
3≤N≤50,000
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (19 points): 3≤N≤3,333

6 10 15
374 595 1365 858


Explanation
Example case 1: Let's check the answer: gcd(6,10)=2, gcd(10,15)=5, gcd(15,6)=3, gcd(6,10,15)=1. Every two cyclically consecutive numbers are not coprime, but every three cyclically consecutive numbers are coprime.
Example case 2:

gcd(374,595)=17, gcd(595,1365)=35, gcd(1365,868)=39, gcd(858,374)=22
gcd(374,595,1365)=1, gcd(595,1365,858)=1, gcd(1365,858,374)=1, gcd(858,374,595)=1
