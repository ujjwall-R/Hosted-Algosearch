Chef has started learning to solve dynamic programming problems recently. He has practiced on a lot of problems already, so he wants to try his hands on the hardest problems in this domain.
Chef only likes the interesting part of solving dynamic programming problems — specifically, he just likes to divide a problem into beautiful subproblems which consist of solving recurrences; he finds actually solving these recurrences quite boring. Since you are Chef's assistant, your job is solving this boring part for Chef.
Let's define a recurrent sequence {dp(k)}∞k=1{dp(k)}∞k=1 with parametres AA, BB and K as follows:

dp(1)=K
for n>1, dp(n)=A⋅dp(n−1)+B⋅n−1∑i=1dp(i)⋅dp(n−i)

Chef would like you to find dp(N). Since this number can be very large, compute it modulo 109+7.
Input
The first and only line of the input contains four space-separated integers N, K, A and B.
Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the value of dp(N) modulo 109+7.
Constraints

1≤N≤107
1≤B,K≤109+7
0≤A≤109+7

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (5 points): N≤5,000
Subtask #2 (10 points): N≤105
Subtask #3 (10 points):

N≤106
A=0

Subtask #4 (25 points): original constraints
Example Input

4 1 2 1

Example Output

57

Explanation
The first four terms of this sequence are:

dp(1)=1
dp(2)=2⋅dp(1)+dp(1)⋅dp(1)=3
dp(3)=2⋅dp(2)+dp(1)⋅dp(2)+dp(2)⋅dp(1)=12
dp(4)=2⋅dp(3)+dp(1)⋅dp(3)+dp(2)⋅dp(2)+dp(3)⋅dp(1)=57
