You are given an integer NN. Find the number of distinct XORs it is possible to make using two positive integers no larger than NN.
Formally, let SS be the set
S={x⊕y∣1≤x,y≤N}S={x⊕y∣1≤x,y≤N}
where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation. 
Find |S| (where |S| denotes the size of set S. Note that a set, by definition, has no repeated elements). The answer might be large, so output it modulo 109+7.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, which contains one integer N.

Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer, modulo 109+7.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤N≤1012

Explanation
Test Case 1: N=1, so the only XOR we can possibly make is 1⊕1=0. Thus, the answer is 1.
Test Case 2: N=3, which gives us S={0,1,2,3} as the set of possible XORs. Thus, the answer is |S|=4.
