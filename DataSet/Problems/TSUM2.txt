You are given a tree with N nodes (numbered 1 through N) and N−1 edges. Each node has a value; let's denote the value of node x by Wx.
Next, let's define the value of a simple path v1,v2,…,vk as ∑ki=1i⋅Wvi. A simple path in a tree is a sequence of nodes v1,v2,…,vk such that:

k≥1
there is an edge between nodes vi and vi+1 for each i (1≤i≤k−1)
vi≠vj for each i,j (1≤i,j≤k) such that i≠j

You should find the maximum of values of all simple paths in the given tree.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers W1,W2,…,WN.
Each of the following N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting an edge between nodes u and v.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum value of a simple path.
Constraints

2≤N≤50,000
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 400,000
1≤u,v≤N
u≠v
|Wi|≤1,000 for each valid i
the graph described in the input is a tree

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (30 points): the tree is a binary tree rooted at node 1
Subtask #2 (30 points):

the length (number of nodes) of any simple path in the tree is at most 200
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 100,000

Subtask #3 (40 points): original constraints
