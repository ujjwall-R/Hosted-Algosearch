Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
Chef has an array A of N elements denoted by A0,A1,…,AN−1.
He thinks about M questions of following kind: "What is the maximum element among Ai where i lies between min(x,y) and max(x,y) both inclusive?"
You have to help Chef to find out sum of answers of all the M questions.
Method of generation of values x and y for all M questions:
You are given two integersx1 and y1 denoting values of x and y for the first question. 
For the next questions, values of xi and yi are generated in the following way:
xi=(xi−1+7)%(N−1)
yi=(yi−1+11)%N
Where % represents the modulo operation.
Input

The first line contains a single integer N, denoting the number of elements in the array. 
The second line contains N space-separated integers, denoting A0,A1,…,AN−1.  
The third line contains three space-separated integers M, x1, and y1.

Output
Output a single integer denoting the sum of the answers to the questions.

Example Input
3
1 2 3
3 0 1

Example Output
7

Explanation

The first question: x1=0, y1=1. Therefore answer for the first query =2.
The second question: x2=(0+7)%2=1, y2=(1+11)%3=0. Therefore answer for the second query =2
The third question: x3=(1+7)%2=0, y3=(0+11)%3=2 . Therefore answer for the third query =3

Therefore, the sum of answers is 7.
