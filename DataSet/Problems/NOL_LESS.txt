You are trying to create an array AA containing NN integers. However, your array-creating-machine has some restrictions. More formally, you are given a constant DD, and two arrays B and C, each with M elements, then:

Ai≤D for all 1≤i≤N
Ai≥Ai−1 for all 1<i≤N
ACj⋅Bj≤D for all 1≤j≤M

Find how many different arrays can you create. Since answer can be big, print it modulo 
998244353.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains 3 integers N, M, and D - the length of the array A you need to create, the length of B and C, the constant from the statement.
The i-th line of the next M lines of each test case contains two integers Ci and Bi.

Output Format
For each test case output a single integer - the number of different arrays you can create modulo 998244353.
Constraints

1≤T≤104
1≤N≤107
1≤M,D≤105
1≤Ci≤N
1≤Bi≤D
It's guaranteed that the sum of M over all test cases doesn't exceed 105, and sum of D over all test cases doesn't exceed 105
It's guaranteed that in each test case all Ci are different

Subtasks

Subtask 1 (30 points): sum of D over all test cases doesn't exceed 3000.
Subtask 2 (70 points): Original constraints.

Explanation

Test case 1: One array is {1,1,1,1} and for each value of last element from 2 to 6, there are 3 possible combinations of first three values: {1,1,1}, {1,1,2}, {1,2,2}. Therefore there are a total of 1+5⋅3=16 possible arrays.
