You are given a sequence aa and its first nn elements. 
The ii-th element of the sequence, where i>n is generated by the following formula.
The i-th element i>n would be the floor of the mean of last n elements of the sequence. Formally,
ai=⌊∑n−1k=0ai−n+kn⌋
For example, 
an+1=⌊a1+a2+..+ann⌋
an+2=⌊a2+a3+..+an+1n⌋
an+3=⌊a3+a4+..+an+2n⌋
You have to answer many queries in which you would be asked to tell some x-th element of the sequence, where x would be provided in the query.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
First line of each test case contains an integer n.
The second of each test case contains n space separated integers where i-th of which denotes value of ai.
The third line contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries.
Each of the next Q lines contains an integer x, denoting that you should tell what's the x-th element of sequence.

Output:
For each query, output an integer denoting the value of the corresponding element of the sequence.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤n≤103
for 1≤i≤n,1≤ai≤103
1≤Q≤105
1≤x≤109

Sample Input:
1
3
2 2 3
3
1
3
4

Sample Output:
2
3
2

Explanation
The 4th element of the array would be ⌊2+2+33⌋=⌊73⌋=2
