Chef has a string SS. A substring of SS is obtained by removing zero or more characters from the beginning and/or end of SS. For each L (1≤L≤|S|):

K times, Chef wants to choose a substring of S with length L uniformly randomly and independently.
Find the probability that all these K substrings will be pairwise distinct. It can be proved that this probability can be expressed as a fraction PQ, where P and Q are integers and Q is coprime with 998,244,353. You should compute P⋅Q−1 modulo 998,244,353, where Q−1 denotes the multiplicative inverse of Q modulo 998,244,353.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a string S followed by a space and an integer K.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing |S| integers. For each valid i, the i-th of these integers should be P⋅Q−1 for L=i.
Constraints

1≤T≤1,000
1≤|S|≤2⋅105
S contains only lowercase English letters
1≤K≤500
the sum of |S| over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105
