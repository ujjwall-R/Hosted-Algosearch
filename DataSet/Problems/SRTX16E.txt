 
Donald trump and Hillary clinton are two major candidates competing in US elections. as we know exaclty N people voted trump, and exactly M voters voted clinton.
As if N > M trump will win.

Each voter will be present at the polling booth one at a time, in an order chosen uniformaly at random from all posssible (N+M)! orders.
After each voter give his vote, polling booth volunteer will update result and note down which person is getting presidency so far
Note:If votes are tied no one is winning.

 
Input
First line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of inputs.
T lines follow each containing 2 integers N and M.

 
Output 

For each test case output the p probability that Trump will always be winning after every vote. in a newline.
Note:Answer Should be exaclty to the six places after decimal.

 
Constraints and Subtasks
Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:

Subtask 1: 30 points
1 ≤ T ≤ 20
1 ≤ M < N ≤ 20

Subtask 2: 70 points
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ M < N ≤ 2000


 
Example
Input:
1
1 0
2 1

Output:
1.000000
0.333333



 
Explanation
Example case 1.
Here is only one voter so there is only one possible order of arrival, and Trump will keep winning after this vote.
Example case 2.
 There are three person. Two of them support trump one of them supports clinton.
  They can come to vote
 in six possible orders: T1 T2 C, T2 T1 C, T1 C T2, T2 C T1, C T1 T2, C T2 T1.
 Only the first 2 of those guarantee that Trump is winning after
 every vote. So the answer is 0.333333.
