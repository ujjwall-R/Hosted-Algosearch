There is going to be a major fair in Government College Of Engineering Nagpur – GCOEN  Named as Adhyaaya . In which there are many events going to happen. There are nn numbers of events you can attend. You know its starting and ending days and the amount of money you could win in the event.But the condition is that you can attend only one event in a day. Tell the maximum amount of money you will win.
Input Format

The first input line contains an integer nn: the number of events.
After this, there are n lines. Each such line has three integers a,b, and m: the starting day, the ending day, and the money .

Output Format

Print one integer: the maximum amount of money you can earn.

Explanation
                    In the given test case, There are 4 events in which you can participate 
-   first event will start on day 2 and end on day 4 
-   second event will start on day 3 and end on day 6 
-   Third event will start on day 6 and end on day 8 
-   Fourth event will start on day 5 and end on day 7 
So, first event and third , first event and fourth event are the only 2 events whose days are not co-inciding. [2,4] && [6,8] and [2,4] && [5,7] respectively.  
if we add prizes of 2 events , we will get prize of (4+2 = 6) in first condition and (4+3 =7) in second condition, so we will print max of them i.e 7.
