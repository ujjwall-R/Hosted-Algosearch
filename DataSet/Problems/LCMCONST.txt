You are given MM triplets (X1,Y1,B1),(X2,Y2,B2),…,(XM,YM,BM)(X1,Y1,B1),(X2,Y2,B2),…,(XM,YM,BM). Find the number of sequences of positive integers A1,A2,…,AN such that for each valid i, lcm(AXi,AYi)=Bi, or determine that there is an infinite number of such sequences.
Since the answer can be very large, compute it modulo 1,000,000,007 (109+7). Note that the values B1,B2,…,BM can also be very large ― you are given their prime decompositions.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.
M lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤M), the i-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers Xi, Yi and Ri, followed by a space and 2Ri space-separated integers p1,e1,p2,e2,…,pRi,eRi, denoting that Bi=∏Rir=1perr.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of valid sequences modulo 1,000,000,007, or −1 if there are infinitely many valid sequences.

Explanation
Example case 1: Both elements of A can be any positive integers, so there is an infinite number of valid sequences.
Example case 2: There are two constraints, but they are actually identical: lcm(A1,A2)=1. The only sequence that satisfies this is A=[1,1].
Example case 3: The two constraints contradict each other, so there is no valid sequence.
