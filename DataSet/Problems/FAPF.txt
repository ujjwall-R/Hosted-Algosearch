Firdavs is living on planet F. There are N cities (numbered 1 through N) on this planet; let's denote the value of city i by vi. Firdavs can travel directly from each city to any other city. When he travels directly from city x to city y, he needs to pay f(x,y)=|vy−vx|+y−x coins (this number can be negative, in which case he receives −f(x,y) coins).
Let's define a simple path from city x to city y with length k≥1 as a sequence of cities a1,a2,…,ak such that all cities in this sequence are different, a1=x and ak=y. The cost of such a path is ∑k−1i=1f(ai,ai+1).
You need to answer some queries for Firdavs. In each query, you are given two cities x and y, and you need to find the minimum cost of a simple path from city x to city y. Then, you need to find the length of the longest simple path from x to y with this cost.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The second line contains N space-separated integers v1,v2,…,vN.
The following Q lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers x and y.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing two space-separated integers ― the minimum cost and the maximum length.

Explanation
Example case 1: For the first query, there are two paths with cost 4 from city 2 to city 3:

2→1→3: cost (|4−2|+1−2)+(|5−4|+3−1)=4, length 3
2→3: cost |5−2|+3−2=4, length 2

All other paths have greater costs, so the minimum cost is 4. Among these two paths, we want the one with greater length, which is 3.
