In Chefland, there are N cities (numbered 1 through N) connected by N−1 bidirectional roads. Each city has exactly one garden. For each valid i, let's denote the population of the i-th city by Ai and the initial number of fruits in its garden by Bi; also, at any time, let's denote the current number of fruits in its garden by Fi (Fi=Bi initially).
You are given a permutation P of the integers 1 through N. For each i (1≤i≤N), during the i-th of the next N days, the people of the city Pi do the following:

For each city j which is reachable from the city Pi (including the city Pi itself), visit the city j and consume min(APi,Fj) fruits from the garden of the city j; afterwards, Fj decreases by min(APi,Fj).
Return to the city Pi and cut off all the roads that are connecting it to other cities, so that nobody can visit the city Pi or visit any other city from their city if it requires passing through the city Pi.

For each valid i, let Di be the first day when the number of fruits in the i-th city's garden becomes zero, or −1 if the fruits in its garden never end up all eaten. Find D1,D2,…,DN.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
Each of the next N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting that vertices u and v are connected by an edge.
The next line contains N space-separated integers P1,P2,…,PN.
The next line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
The last line contains N space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers D1,D2,…,DN.

Explanation
Example case 1: The process is as follows:

On day 1, people from city 1 eat 1 fruit from each garden. Afterwards, there are [0,2,5] fruits in the gardens of cities [1,2,3] respectively, so the answer for city 1 is 1, since the number of fruits in this garden becomes zero on day 1.
Then, on day 2, people from city 2 eat 2 fruits from each of the gardens in cities 2 and 3. Afterwards, there are 0 fruits in the garden of city 2 (so the answer for city 2 is 2, since the number of fruits in this garden becomes zero on this day) and 3 fruits in the garden of city 3.
Finally, on day 3, people from city 3 eat 3 fruits from the garden of city 3, so the answer for city 3 is 3.
