You are a citizen of Arrayland. Your President (Mr. P) has given you a mundane problem:


You're given an array a with size N (1-based indexing). You are allowed to perform an arbitrary number (including zero) of operations of the following type: choose an integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ N) and swap ai with aN-i+1.


Your goal is to make the array a great. An array is great if it satisfies one of the following conditions:

a1 > a2 < a3 > a4 < ... aN
a1 < a2 > a3 < a4 > ... aN


Compute the minimum number of operations necessary to make the array a great or determine that it's impossible to make it great.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of the array a.
The second line contains N space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., aN.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of operations required to make the array great, or -1 if it's impossible.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 5
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ ai ≤ 109 for each valid i

Explanation
Example case 1: The given array is NOT great. If you swap the second and the fifth element, then the array becomes great.
