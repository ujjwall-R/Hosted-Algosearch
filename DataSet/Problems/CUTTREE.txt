A forest is an undirected acyclic graph. Let us define the strength of a forest as the sum of squares of sizes of its connected components. (Clearly, a tree with n nodes has strength n2.)

Chef has found a tree with N nodes on day 0. On each of the next N-1 days, he's going to remove one edge. Let's denote the forest that remains after i days by Fi, for each 1 ≤ i ≤ N-1; also, let's denote the original tree by F0. On day i, Fi is created by randomly uniformly choosing one edge from Fi-1 and removing it.


Let Ei be the expected value of strength of the forest Fi, for each 0 ≤ i ≤ N-1. It can be proven that this number can be written in the form Pi / Qi, where gcd(Pi, Qi) = 1 and gcd(Qi, 109 + 7) = 1. Let Ri = Pi · Qi-1 mod 109 + 7, where Qi-1 denotes the modular inverse of Qi modulo 109 + 7.


Find the values of R0, R1, ..., RN-1.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N — the number of nodes in the tree.
N-1 lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting an edge between nodes u and v in the tree.

Output

Print a single line containing N space-separated integers R0, R1, ..., RN-1.

Constraints

 1 ≤ N ≤ 105 
 1 ≤ u, v ≤ N
