	There is a directed acyclic graph with N vertices. The vertices are numbered from 1 to N.

	For every 1 ≤ i ≤ N-1, there is an edge from vertex i to vertex i+1, which has weight ai.

	For every 1 ≤ i ≤ N-2, there is an edge from vertex i to vertex i+2, which has weight bi.

	For every 1 ≤ i ≤ N-3, there is an edge from vertex i to vertex i+3, which has weight ci.

	There are no other edges.

	For each pair of vertices s, t where s < t, let d(s, t) denote the length of the shortest path from s to t. Your task is to compute the sum of d(s, t) for every 1 ≤ s < t ≤ N.

	Input

	First line of the input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases. T test cases follow.

	For each test case:

	The first line contains an integer N.

	The second line contains N - 1 integers a1, a2, ..., aN-1.

	The third line contains N - 2 integers b1, b2, ..., bN-2.


		The fourth line contains N - 3 integers c1, c2, ..., cN-3.


	Output

	For each test case, output a single line containing an integer, denoting the answer. It can be proved that the answer fits in the signed 64-bit type.

	Constraints


1 ≤ T ≤ 104

4 ≤ N ≤ 105

1 ≤ sum of N over all test cases  ≤ 3*105

1 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 104


	Subtasks

	Subtask #1 (8 points):


N ≤ 103.

1 ≤ sum of N over all test cases  ≤ 104.



	Subtask #2: (13 points):


bi = ai + ai+1.

ci = ai + ai+1 + ai+2.



	Subtask #3: (46 points):


ci = ai + ai+1 + ai+2.



	Subtsak #4: (33 points): 

Original constraints.



	Example
Input:
2
4
1 1 1
1 1
1
5
1 2 3 4
2 3 4
3 4

Output:
6
31
Explanation
Example case 1. In this test case the distance between the node A and the node B will be equal to one for all pairs (A, B). So for all six pairs we get the distance 1 and the final sum 6.
