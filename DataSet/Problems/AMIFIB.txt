The Head Chef has been playing with Fibonacci numbers for long . He has learnt several tricks related to Fibonacci numbers . Now he wants to test his chefs in the skills .  
A fibonacci number is defined by the recurrence : 
f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) for n > 2 and f(1) = 0 and f(2) = 1 .  
Given a number  A   , determine if it is a fibonacci number.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains a single integer  A  denoting the number to be checked .
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing "YES" if the given number is a fibonacci number , otherwise output a single line containing "NO" . 
Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ number of digits in A  ≤ 1000
  The sum of number of digits in A in all test cases   <= 10000.  


                        Sample Input 1
                        





3
3

                        Sample Output 1
                        





YES
NO
YES


Explanation
Example case 1. The first few fibonacci numbers are 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 ,5 , 8 , 13 and so on and the series is increasing . Only 3 and 5 appear in this series while 4 does not appear in the series .
