For a sequence of integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN, let G(A)G(A) denote a graph with N nodes (numbered 1 through N) such that for each pair of distinct nodes i and j, there is an undirected edge between these nodes if and only if Ai⋅Aj is a perfect square.
You are given a graph with N nodes (numbered 1 through N) and an integer K. Find the number of integer sequences  A1,A2,…,AN such that 1≤Ai≤K for each valid i and the given graph is a subgraph of G(A). Since this number might be very large, compute it modulo 998,244,353.
Note that the graph is described in an unusual way ― you are given M non-intersecting ranges [L1,R1],[L2,R2],…,[LM,RM] and for each valid i, the graph contains undirected edges between nodes Li and Li+1, between nodes Li+1 and Li+2, and so on up to an edge between nodes Ri−1 and Ri.
Notes:

An integer X is a perfect square if there is an integer Y such that X = Y2.
A simple graph B with N nodes is a subgraph of a simple graph A with N identically numbered nodes if for each valid pair of nodes u and v connected by an edge in B, there is also an edge connecting nodes u and v in A. Refer to the following animation for more clarity:


Input

The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers N, K and M.
M lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Li and Ri.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer ― the number of valid sequences modulo 998,244,353.
Constraints

1≤N≤1010
1≤K≤1014
0≤M≤105
1≤Li<Ri≤N for each valid i
Ri−Li+1≤105 for each valid i
Ri−1<Li for each valid i
