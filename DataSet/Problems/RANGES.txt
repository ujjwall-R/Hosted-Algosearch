There are NN hills, each having the elevation associated with it. You need to find out the hill range of length KK having the maximum beauty.
A range can be formed by deleting some of the hills from the array of elevations.
A hill range XX is more beautiful than another hill range Y (of the same length) if in the first hill where X and Y differ, X has a lower elevation than the Y.
The length of a range is the number of hills present in it.
Input:

First-line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
First Line of each test case will have two integers N,K. 
Second-line will have N integers representing the elevation of hills.

Output:

For each test case, output K integers representing the elevation of hills in the most beautiful range.

Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤N≤104
1≤K≤N

Subtasks

20 points : 1≤N≤10
80 points : 1≤N≤104

Sample Input:
    1
    4 2
    3 5 2 6 

Sample Output:
    2 6

EXPLANATION:
Possible ranges are {[3,5], [3,2], [3,6], [5,2], [5,6], [2,6]}. 
Among these [2, 6] is the most beautiful and hence is the answer.
