Chef has N segments. For each i (1 ≤ i ≤ N), the i-th segment starts at point Li and ends at point Ri (let's denote it by [Li,  Ri]).
Let's say that a segment [l, r] crosses a point x if l ≤ x ≤ r.
Chef wants you to answer Q queries. In each query, you are given a set of M distinct points X1, X2, ..., XM; you should compute the number of good segments [Li, Ri] among the given N segments. A segment is good if it crosses an odd number of points out of the given M points.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments.
The following N lines describe the segments. For each i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Li and Ri.
The next line contains a single integer Q denoting the number of queries.
The following Q lines describe the queries. Each of these lines starts with an integer M — the number of points in this query, followed by M space-separated integers X1, X2, ..., XM.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ Q ≤ N ≤ 100,000
sum of M for all queries ≤ N
sum of N over all test cases ≤ 200,000
1 ≤ Xi ≤ N for each valid i
all Xi in each query are distinct
1 ≤ Li ≤ Ri ≤ N for each valid i

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (10 points): N, Q ≤ 300
Subtask #2 (90 points): original constraints
Output
For each query, print a single line containing the number of good segments for that query.
