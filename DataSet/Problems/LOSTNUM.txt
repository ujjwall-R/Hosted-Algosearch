Jackson, a tiny tot, just learned numbers. He is putting his efforts to jot them down as well. He wrote numbers in sequence and went to have milk. Unfortunately, he has an elder mischievous brother who comes in and edits a few numbers. (He may even add negative numbers)

(The sum of all test cases does not exceed 5∗1055∗105)

Output:
Print the smallest missing natural number. If all n numbers are present, print n+1.
