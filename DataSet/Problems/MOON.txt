Santa has N truffles and M candies to divide between his two buddy elves such that both have equal amounts of total sweetness. Each truffle has a sweetness value of X and each candy has a sweetness value of Y.
Note: A unit of truffle or candy cannot be divided further and no item can be left out after division.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, four integers N,M,X,Y. 

Output:
For each testcase, print "YES" in a newline if it possible to divide all the candies and truffles into two equal parts of sweetness values,
Else, print "NO" in a newline.  
Constraints

1≤T≤103
0≤N,M≤102
0≤X,Y≤105

Sample Input:
3
3 2 2 3
2 0 1 10
1 2 5 4

Sample Output:
YES
YES
NO

EXPLANATION:
In the first test case, all the truffles can be given to one elf and all the candies to another.
Sweetness value with elf1 = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
Sweetness value with elf2 = 3 + 3 = 6.
Thus, both have equal amounts.
