A sophomore Computer Science student is frustrated with boring college lectures. Professor X agreed to give him some questions; if the student answers all questions correctly, then minimum attendance criteria will not apply to him.
Professor X chooses a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and asks QQ queries. In each query, the student is given an integer PP; he has to construct a sequence B1,B2,…,BN, where P⊕Ai=Bi for each valid i (⊕ denotes bitwise XOR), and then he has to find the number of elements of this sequence which have an even number of 1-s in the binary representation and the number of elements with an odd number of 1-s in the binary representation. Help him answer the queries.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
Q lines follow. Each of these lines contains a single integer P describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing two space-separated integers ― the number of elements with an even number of 1-s and the number of elements with an odd number of 1-s in the binary representation.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤N,Q≤105
T⋅(N+Q)≤4⋅106
1≤Ai≤108 for each valid i
1≤P≤105

The input/output is quite large, please use fast reading and writing methods.

Explanation
Example case 1: The elements of the sequence B are P⊕4=7, P⊕2=1, P⊕15=12, P⊕9=10, P⊕8=11 and P⊕8=11. The elements which have an even number of 1-s in the binary representation are 12 and 10, while the elements with an odd number of 1-s are 7, 1, 11 and 11.
