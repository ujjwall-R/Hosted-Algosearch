Adam Strange has arrived to warn Seg-El regarding the imminent danger of Brainiac. Brainiac has planned to degrade the very core of Krypton.
Seg-El must develop a power source to prevent immediate destruction. The core of the planet is in an unusual form of a tree. 
 The tree has N nodes. Each node has a value Ai associated with it. Seg-El needs to monitor Q paths. For each of those paths, he needs to find -
 
 where i and j are two distinct nodes along the path. 
 Since the task is tough, help Seg-El in this task. 
 
Input
First line of each input file comprises two space separated integers, N- denoting the number of nodes of the tree and Q- denoting the number of queries. 
Second lines comprises N space separated integers denoting the value of the nodes Ai
 The next N-1 lines contains two separated integers X and Y, denoting a bi-directional edge between these nodes. 
The next Q lines contains two separated integers U and V , indicating the path from node U to node V to be monitored. 
 
Output
For each of the Q queries, print the minimum value Seg-El can obtain as per the mentioned criteria on a separate line. 

Constraints

2 ≤ N ≤  50000 
1 ≤ Q ≤  50000 
1 ≤ X,Y ≤  N
1 ≤ U,V ≤  N , U!=V 
1 ≤  Ai ≤  109 

 
Example
Input

5 1
1 2 3 4 5
1 4
1 3
4 2
1 5 
2 5

Output:
3
 
Explanation
The answer is 3 as it is the least possible difference on the path from node 2 to node 5. It is because of value at node 2 and at node 1 i.e |22-12|=3
