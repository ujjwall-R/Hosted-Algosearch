Please refer to sample test in English version of statement.
Except for that, you can read problem statement in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese.
There are N ice-creams placed in a row in a shop, where the i-th has cost C[i] and flavor F[i]. Chef wants to buy some consecutive segment of ice-creams so that their total cost doesn't exceed his budget K, and he can mix some subset of bought ice-creams to make a new ice-cream with maximum possible flavor.
Mixing m ice-creams of flavors A1, A2, .., Am will result in an ice-cream of flavor equal to A1 ^ A2 ^ ... ^ Am where ^ is the xor operation. 
What is maximum possible flavor that Chef can get?
It's guaranteed that at least one ice-cream has cost that doesn't exceed Chef's budget.

Input
First line contains an integer T, which is the number of test-cases.
The first line of each test-case contains two integers: N and K.
Each of the following N lines contains two integers C[i] and F[i]. 
Output
Output the answer of each test-case in new line, the maximum flavor that the Chef can get.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10,000
1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000
sum of N in all test-cases will not exceed 100,000
1 ≤ K ≤ 10^14
1 ≤ F[i] ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ C[i] ≤ 10^9
C[i] ≤ K for at least one i

Explanation
Test case 1: The binary representations of the 5 flavors, in order, are: (0100, 0001, 1001, 0110, 1100), and the corresponding prices are (2,7,5,15,3).
If Chef buys only the 5th ice-cream with cost 3 and flavor 12. But if Chef buys the first 3 ice-creams, his total cost is 2+7+5 = 14, which is within his budget of 15, and hence valid. Now, from these three bought ice-creams, he can choose to mix just the first and third, and get a flavor of 0100^1001 = 1101, which is  13. You can verify that this is the best that he can do.
Test case 2: Chef can afford the first or the last ice-cream. He could afford them both but he must buy a consecutive segment of ice-creams while the cost of the second ice-cream is beyond his budget.
It's optimal to buy the first ice-cream only and use its flavor only, what gives us the answer 8.
