You are given a string s consisting of upper case Latin alphabets, i.e. from 'A' to 'Z'. Your task is to find how many strings t with length equal to that of S, also consisting of upper case Latin alphabet are there satisfying the following conditions:

String t is lexicographical larger than s
When you write both s and t in the reverse order, t is still lexicographical larger than s.



Find out number of such strings t. As the answer could be very large, output it modulo 109 + 7

Input

The only line of input contains string s.

Output

Output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the result in modulo 109 + 7.

Constraints

1 ≤ |S| ≤ 105

Example
Input 1:
ZAZ

Output 1:
25

Input 2:
XYZ

Output 2:
5

Explanation

Test #1: To make a valid string t, you can just replace the letter A in S by any other letter, e.g. by replacing 'A' by 'B', we get t = ZBZ. Note that ZBZ is lexicographically larger than ZAZ. Reverse of t (i.e. ZBZ) is also lexicographically larger than reverse of s (i.e. ZAZ).


Test #2: there are 5 valid strings: YYZ, ZYZ, XZZ, YZZ, ZZZ
