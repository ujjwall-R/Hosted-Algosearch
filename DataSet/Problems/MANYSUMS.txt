You are given a range of integers {L,L+1,…,R}{L,L+1,…,R}. An integer XX is said to be reachable if it can be represented as a sum of two not necessarily distinct integers in this range. Find the number of distinct reachable integers.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers L and R.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of reachable integers.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤L≤R≤106


                        Sample Input 1
                        





2
2 2
2 3



                        Sample Output 1
                        





1
3


Explanation
Example case 1: The only reachable integer is 2+2=4.
Example case 2: 4, 5 and 6 are reachable, since 2+2=4, 2+3=5 and 3+3=6.
