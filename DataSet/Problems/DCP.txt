A thermal decomposition reaction is breakdown of a compound into one or more compounds when heated.
For example, P→a⋅Q+b⋅R is a decomposition reaction. Here, 1 unit of P is converted into a unit of Q and b unit of R after completion of the reaction.
You are given N compounds numbered from 1 to N. The initial amount of the ith compound is Qi. 
You are also given M equations. Every equation is of the form: 
C0→W1⋅C1+W2⋅C2+…+WX⋅CX.
Here:

C0 represents the compound which will decompose into X compounds on heating.
Ci (1≤i≤X) represents the compounds into which C0 is decomposed.
Wi (1≤i≤X) represents the number of units of Ci produced due to the decomposition of C0.
Ci>Ci−1 for all (1≤i≤X).

Note that a compound can decompose in at most one way only.
Find the final amount of each compound after prolonged heating. Since the number can be huge, print the answer modulo 109+7.
Input Format

First line will contain two space separated integers N and M - the number of compounds and the number of equations.
Second line will contain N space separated integers Q1,Q2,...,QN - the initial amounts of each compound.
The next 2⋅M lines contain the details of the M equations.  Each equation is represented using 2 lines.
First line of the ith equation contains two space separated integers Ci,0, Xi - the decomposing compound and the number of compounds in which it decomposes.
Second line of the ith equation contains 2⋅Xi space separated integers Wi,1,Ci,1,Wi,2,Ci,2,…,Wi,Xi,Ci,Xi - the number of units and the types of compounds into which Ci,0 decomposes. 

Output Format
Print N lines. The ith line contains a single integer denoting the final amount of the ith compound after prolonged heating modulo 109+7.

Explanation
Test Cse 1: We have 4 compounds initially. For better explanation, we refer the compounds 1,2,3, and 4 as A1,A2,A3, and A4 respectively. Initially, the amount of A1,A2,A3, and A4 present is 5,10,12, and 2 respectively.
The two equations are:

A1→3⋅A2+4⋅A3
A3→2⋅A4

We know that 1 unit of A1 produces 3 units of A2 and 4 units of A3. Thus, the initial 5 units of A1 decompose to 5⋅3=15 units of A2 and 5⋅4=20 units of A3. Note that now there are 0 units of A1 left.
Considering only this reaction, the updated amounts of chemicals would be [0,10+15,12+20,2]=[0,25,32,2].
We also know that 1 unit of A3 decomposes to 2 units of A4. The total amount of A3 available for decomposition would be 32 units (12 units were available initially and 20 units were formed due to decomposition). Thus these 32 units would produce 32⋅2=64 units of A4.
Thus, after prolonged heating, the amounts of compounds are [0,25,0,64+2]=[0,25,0,66].
