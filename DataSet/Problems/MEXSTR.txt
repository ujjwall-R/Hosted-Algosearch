You are given a binary string SS. Chef defines MEX(S)MEX(S) as the smallest non-negative integer such that its binary representation (without leading '0'-s; in particular, the binary representation of 00 is "0") is not a subsequence of S.
Chef is asking you to find MEX(S). Since this integer could be very large, find its binary representation (without leading '0'-s).
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single string S.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one string: MEX(S) in binary representation.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤|S|≤106
S contains only characters '0' and '1'
the sum of |S| over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅106

1100
0


Explanation
Example case 1: All integers between 0 and 11 inclusive, in binary representation, appear in S as subsequences. However, the binary representation of 12 (which is "1100") is not a subsequence of S.
Example case 2: Since S contains only '1'-s, the string "0" is not a subsequence of S and therefore MEX(S)=0.
