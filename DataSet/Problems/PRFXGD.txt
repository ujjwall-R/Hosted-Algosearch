Chef got a string S with length N as his birthday gift. A prefix of this string is good if each character occurs in it at most X times.
Chef can delete at most K characters from this string. He wants to maximise the number of good prefixes in the resulting string. Can you help him?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single string S.
The second line contains two space-separated integers K and X.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum number of good prefixes.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤N,X≤10,000
|S|=N
0≤K≤10,000
S contains only lowercase English letters

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (50 points): K=0
Subtask #2 (50 points): original constraints

Explanation
Example case 1: Chef cannot delete any characters and each character may occur only once in a good prefix, so there are only six good prefixes.
