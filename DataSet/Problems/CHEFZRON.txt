Chef has a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. The sequence is circular, i.e. for each valid ii, elements Ai and Ai+1 are considered adjacent, and elements A1 and AN are also considered adjacent. Initially, each element of this sequence is either 1 or 0.
You may perform some operations on this sequence. In one operation, you should choose an index i such that Ai=1 and move that 1 to one of its adjacent elements, i.e. change Ai to 0, choose one of the elements adjacent to Ai and increment it by 1.
According to Chef, a sequence is good if all its elements are different from 1. You have to tell Chef the minimum number of operations needed to turn the sequence A into a good sequence or determine that it is impossible.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum number of required operations, or −1 if it is impossible to make the sequence good.
Constraints

1≤T≤104
3≤N≤106

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (30 points):

N=1,000

Explanation
Example case 1: The sequence is already good, so the answer is zero.
Example case 2: We can make the sequence good in two operations, e.g. [1,0,1,0]→[0,1,1,0]→[0,0,2,0].
Example case 3: We can make the sequence good in three operations, e.g. [1,1,0,1,0]→[0,2,0,1,0]→[0,2,1,0,0]→[0,3,0,0,0].
