You are given two binary strings AA and BB with the same length.
You may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero): pick a substring of AA with odd length and invert all the bits (change '0' to '1' or vice versa) at odd positions in this substring. For example, if we choose a substring "01011", we can convert it to "11110" (bits at odd positions are bold).
Determine the minimum number of operations required to change the string A to the string B.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single string A.
The second line contains a single string B.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of operations required.
Constraints

1≤T≤103
1≤|A|=|B|≤105
A and B contain only characters '0' and '1'
the sum of |A| over all test cases does not exceed 105

Explanation
Example case 1: Initially, A is "100001". We choose the substring "000" between the 2-nd and 4-th character and convert it to "101".
Now A becomes "110101". We choose the string "0" containing only the 5-th character and convert it to "1".
Finally, A becomes "110111", which is equal to B.
Example case 2: A and B are initially equal, so there is no need to perform any operation.
