Your task is to help Chef to find the maximum possible sum of the beauties of the remaining flower plants.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
First line of each testcase contains of a single line of input, an integer N.
Second line of each testcase contains N integers h[0],h[1],…,h[N−1] separated by a single space.The height of flower plants.
Third line of each testcase contains N integers b[0],b[1],…,b[N−1] separated by a single space.The beauty of flower plants.

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line answer the maximum possible sum of the beauties of the remaining flower plants.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
2≤N≤104
1≤hi≤N
1≤bi≤109

Sample Input:
1
4
3 1 4 2
10 20 30 40
Sample Output:
60
