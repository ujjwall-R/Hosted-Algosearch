 
Little johny was working on the co-ordinate plane.As he is still a novice he calculates the distance between two points P1 and P2 in the wrong way.He calculates the distance between P1(x1,y1) and P2(x2,y2) as :
D(P1,P2) = |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|
His teacher gave him a homework to calculate the area of a circle of radius R. Johny is aware of the definitions of all the figures just like any smart kid is. He knows that a circle is the locus of the point at a fixed radius from the center of the circle in a plane..
 
Input
The first line of input will contain T- number of test cases.It will be followed by T lines each containing the radius R
Output
For every test case output in a separate line the largest integer less than or equal to the area of the circle as calculated by johny..
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10000
1 ≤ R ≤ 100000000

 
Example
Input:
1
1

Output:
2.
