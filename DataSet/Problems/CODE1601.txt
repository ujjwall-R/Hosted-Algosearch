In a meeting Monti is given a binary string of N characters. A binary string is string consisting of only 0's and 1's. Monti can swap any adjacent pair of characters in one operation. Monti has to bring at least M 1's together starting at any position of the string. Help him count the minimum number of operations required to do so.
It is guaranteed that there are at least M 1's present in the given string.
Input
First line contains single integer T. Number of test cases.
Next 2 * T lines represent T test cases. Each test case is described by two lines; first line contains a single integer M and the second line contains the input binary string.
Output
Output T lines, one for each test case containing the answer for that case.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 50000
1 ≤ M ≤ N

Sum of N over all the cases if less than or equal to 50000
Example
Input:

2
3
101001
2
101001

Output:
