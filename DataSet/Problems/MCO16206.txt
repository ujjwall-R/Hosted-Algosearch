 
Fluffy the squirrel is having a workout to keep his body fit. He arrives at a country with n cities arranged in a circle. There is a uni-directional road connecting city i and city i + 1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1, with length li kilometres and also there is a road connecting city n and city 1, with length ln kilometres. Fluffy starts at city 1. Every day, he can run at most x kilometres. However, staying in the middle of the road is dangerous, so he cannot reach the next city in time, he'll just stay in his current city and wait for the next day. 

Fluffy would like to travel a total of y kilometres to become fit. He wonders what is the minimum number of days needed for him to do that. Can you help him?
 
Input
The first line contains an integer n, the number of cities. The next line contains n space-seperated integers li, as described above. The next line contains two space-seperated integers, x and y, the maximum distance Fluffy can run per day and the total distance Fluffy needs to run.
Output
Output a single integer, d, the minimum number of days needed for Fluffy to travel the desired distance. If the task is impossible, output -1 instead.
Constraints

3 ≤ n ≤ 200000
1 ≤ li, x ≤ 109
1 ≤ y ≤ 1018

Subtasks

Subtask 1 (17 points) : n ≤ 5000
Subtask 2 (12 points) : li is equal for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n
Subtask 3 (26 points) : The answer is either -1 or at most equal to 250000
Subtask 4 (45 points) : Original Constraints

Example
Input 1:
3
4 4 8
12 33

Output 1:
4


Input 2:
3
4 4 10
9 9

Output 2:
-1

 
Explanation
Example case 1. On the first day, Fluffy travels 4 + 4 = 8 kilometres by going from town 1 to town 3. He can't go any further because he can walk at most 12 kilometres a day. The next day, he travels to town 2, walking another 8 + 4 = 12 kilometres. On the third day, he goes to town 1, travelling another 4 + 8 = 12 kilometres. At this point, he travelled 8 + 12 + 12 = 32 kilometres, still short of the target which is 33 kilometres. The next day, he will walk 8 more kilometres and reach his target.

Example case 2. Fluffy will walk to town 3 on the first day, travelling 8 kilometres. However, he will never reach his target, which is 9 kilometres, because the next road is 10 kilometres long and he can walk at most 9 kilometres a day. So, he can never reach his goal and the answer is -1.
