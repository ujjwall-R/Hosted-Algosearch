You are given a tree with NN nodes (numbered 11 through NN). A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.
You have to assign an integer to each node; for each valid ii, let's denote the integer assigned to node i by Ai. This assignment must satisfy the following conditions:

For each valid i, 1≤Ai≤2⋅1018.
For each simple path in the tree, let's denote the set of nodes in this path by S. Then, the product P=∏v∈SAv is divisible by |S|.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
Each of the next N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting that nodes u and v are connected by an edge.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
If there any multiple solutions, you may find any one of them. It can be proved a solution always exists under the given constraints.
Constraints

1≤T≤200
1≤N≤100
1≤u,v≤N

Example Input
2
6
1 2
2 3
1 4
5 1
6 5
2
1 2

Example Output
2 3 2 4 6 5
1 2

Explanation
Example case 1:

This assignment satisfies all the conditions. For example, for the path 2→1→5→6, the product P=3⋅2⋅6⋅5=180 is divisible by 4 (the number of nodes in the path).
