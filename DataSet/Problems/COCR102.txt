Every Story has a Endgame . But ,there are some untold stories.  This is one of those stories.
Captain borrowed SS Infinity Stones from their respective timelines to defeat Archon ( Evil Omni King of Anime War). Now Captain wants to return all the infinity stones in their respective timelines. Let us denote dimensions of  time and space  as xx and yy coordinate. 
Captain can only move forward either in time or in space to move into another timeline.
Captain must visit all coordinates  which consist of an infinity stone . Two timelines are considered to be different if they have different Time and Space Dimensions. He cannot go back in time or space.
Their are K timelines in which Thanos lived . In these timelines, Thanos is inevitable. If Captain visits either of these timelines, then Thanos will kill the Captain. So Captain has to avoid these timelines.  
Doctor strange is busy in fighting with Dormammu. So Doctor Strange asked you to find the total no. of paths by which Captain can return the Infinity Stones and come back safely.
Since this number can be huge compute it modulo  109+7.    
Initially Captain is at timeline (Xinitial,Yinitial) and he has to reach (Xfinal,Yfinal). 
As only these two timelines are same in whole time world. 
Input:

First line contains T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains several lines of input.           
First line contains  four space separated integers Xinitial,Yinitial,Xfinal,Yfinal 
Second line contains two space separated integers S,K .               
Next S lines contains two space separated integers ai,bi denoting coordinate of ith infinity stone.               
Next K lines contains two space separated integers Ai,Bi denoting  ith  coordinate in which Thanos lives.                 

Output:

For each testcase,  output  −1 if Captain cannot  safely reach the destination (In Particular if number of paths is 0 output −1). Else output in a single line no. of safe paths by which Captain can reach destination modulo 1000000007.

Constraints

1≤T≤50
0≤S,K≤103
0≤Xinitial<Xfinal≤105
0≤Yinitial<Yfinal≤105 
0≤Ai,Bi≤105
Xinitial < ai <  Xfinal
Yinitial < bi <  Yfinal
(ai,bi),(Ai,Bi),(Xinitial,Yinitial),(Xfinal,Yfinal)  are pairwise distinct. 

Sample Input:
2
1 1 2 2      
1 1         
1 2            
2 1             
1 1 3 3                            
0 2                       
1 2                      
2 1                    

Sample Output:
1       
-1

EXPLANATION:

Test case 1: Possible path (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) Captain can't visit  (2,1) because Thanos lives there.              
Test case 2: There is no possible path from (1,1) to (3,3) because (1,1) → (1,2) and (1,1) → (2,1) both paths are invalid as Captain can't visit (1,2) and (2,1) because Thanos lives there.
