Explanation
Test Case 11: Chef needs to increase his worth by 200−100=100200−100=100 billion dollars and his increment per year being 1010 billion dollars, so it will take him 10010=1010010=10 years to do so.
Test Case 2: Chef needs to increase his worth by 199−111=88 billion dollars and his increment per year being 11 billion dollars, so it will take him 8811=8 years to do so.
Test Case 3: Chef needs to increase his worth by 200−190=10 billion dollars and his increment per year being 10 billion dollars, so it will take him 1010=1 year to do so.
