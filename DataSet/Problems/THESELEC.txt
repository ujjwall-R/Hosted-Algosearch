You are given NN integers A1,A2,...,ANA1,A2,...,AN. You are also given QQ queries. Each query i (1≤i≤Q) is of the following type: 
Li Ri Xi: meaning, add the value Xi to all the integers in the array whose indices lie in the range [Li,Ri].
Your task is to tell the maximum possible sum of all the elements of the array if you are allowed to choose at most K (≤Q) queries among the given queries. 
Input:

First line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then T the test cases follow. 
First line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N,Q and K.
Second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,...,AN.
Then follows Q lines, each containing three space-separated integers Li,Ri and Xi.

Output:
For each test case, output in a single line the required answer.
