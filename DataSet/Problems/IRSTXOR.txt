You are given an integer CC. Let dd be the smallest integer such that 2d2d is strictly greater than C.
Consider all pairs of non-negative integers (A,B) such that A,B<2d and A⊕B=C (⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation). Find the maximum value of A⋅B over all these pairs.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer C.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum possible product A⋅B.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤C≤109

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (30 points): 1≤C≤103
Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints

2
13
10



                        Sample Output 1
                        





70
91


Explanation
Example case 1: The binary representation of 13 is "1101". We can use A=10 ("1010" in binary) and B=7 ("0111" in binary). This gives us the product 70. No other valid pair (A,B) can give us a larger product.
Example case 2: The binary representation of 10 is "1010". We can use A=13 ("1101") and B=7 ("0111"). This gives us the maximum product 91.
