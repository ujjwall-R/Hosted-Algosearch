Given two integers AA and BB.

Let P denote a sequence of N prime numbers such that the sum of the sequence is A.
Let Q denote a sequence of M prime numbers such that the sum of the sequence is B.

Let X denote the maximum absolute difference between Pi and Qj among all valid pairs (i,j) such that (1≤i≤N) and (1≤j≤M).
Find the minimum possible value of X over all possible sequences P and Q.
More formally, for all possible sequences P and Q, find the minimum value of max(|Pi−Qj|), where (1≤i≤N) and (1≤j≤M).
Print −1 if any one of the sequences cannot be formed.
Note that, |X| denotes the absolute value of a number X. For example, |−4|=4 and |7|=7.
Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains two integers A and B.

Output Format
For each test case, find the minimum possible value of the maximum absolute difference between Pi and Qj for (1≤i≤N) and (1≤j≤M). If any of the sequences can not be formed, print −1 instead.
Constraints

Explanation
Test case 1: Let P={3} and Q={3,3}.
The maximum absolute difference is 0. It can be shown that the maximum absolute difference can not be less than 0.
Test case 2: The only possible sequences are P={3} and Q={2}.
The maximum absolute difference is 1. It can be shown that the maximum absolute difference can not be less than 1.
