You are given N sticks, where the length of each stick is a positive integer. A cut operation is performed on the sticks such that all of them are reduced by the length of the smallest stick.
Given the length of N sticks, print the number of sticks that are left before each subsequent cut operations.
Note: For each cut operation, you have to recalculate the length of smallest sticks (excluding zero-length sticks).

Input

The first line contains a single integer N. 
The next line contains N integers separated by space, where each integer represents the length of the ith stick.

Output

For each operation, print the number of sticks that are cut, on separate lines.

Constraints

1 <= N <= 50000
1 <= stick length <= 1000000

Example
Input:
6
5 4 4 2 2 8

Output:
6
4
2
1
