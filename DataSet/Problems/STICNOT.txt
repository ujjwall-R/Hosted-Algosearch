You are given a tree with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN). Its edges are numbered 1 through N−1. For each valid i, there is an integer ai written on the i-th vertex. Also, for each valid i, there is an integer bi written on the i-th edge.
You want the following condition to be satisfied: for each vertex v and each edge e adjacent to v, av≥be. In order to achieve that, you may perform an arbitrary number of steps (including zero). In one step, you may perform one the following operations:

Select two different vertices u and v. Swap au and av.
Select two different edges e and f. Swap be and bf.
Select a vertex v and an integer x. Change av to x and pay one coin.

Calculate the minimum number of coins you need in order to satisfy the required condition.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
N−1 lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤N−1), the i-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers ui, vi and bi denoting that the i-th edge connects vertices ui and vi and the initial value written on it is bi.
The last line contains N space-separated integers a1,a2,…,aN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum necessary number of coins.

Explanation
Example case 1: There is no way to satisfy the required condition without paying any coins. When we have one coin, we can perform the following operations:

Swap the integers written on vertices 1 and 2.
Pay one coin and change the integer written on vertex 2 to 7.
