Find the nth term of a series for which if it is given that if n is less than 2 then the nth term is 1 and if n is greater than or equals to 2 and less than 4 nth term is 2 else nth term will be equal to the difference of (n+2)th term and (n-2)th term.


 tn = t(n+2) - t(n-2)   Where n ≥ 4 
The answer could be very large, so compute it modulo with 109 + 7 
Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N 

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the nth term of the series with modulo 109 + 7 

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 105 
1 ≤ N ≤ 105 

Example
Input:
2
2
5
Output:
2
3

Explanation
Example case 1.for n=2 , t2 = 2
