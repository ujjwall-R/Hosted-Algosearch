You are given the first N terms of a sequence.
The remaining terms of the sequence are defined as follows:

A [ i ] = number of j such that 0 ≤ j < i and A[ j ] ≥ i - j

The sequence is indexed starting at 0.
The first N terms of the sequence will each be equal to N-1, N, or N+1.
In addition to the first terms of the sequence, you will be given a number of queries.
For each query you are to calculate the value of the sequence at that index.
Input
Input will begin with an integer T, the number of test cases.
Each test case begins with 2 integers N and Q on a line,
followed by a line with N integers (each equal to N-1, N, or N+1),
then a line with Q non-negative integers.
Output
For each test case, output Q integers on a line, one per query,
indicating the respective element of the sequence.
Sample Input
3

3 4
3 3 3
100 1000 1000000 1

4 11
3 4 4 5
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

5 4
5 6 5 6 5
6 14 22 29

Sample Output

5 5 5 5

Constraints

T≤100
0<N≤100000
0<Q≤100000
Each query will be between 0 and 10^15, inclusive
The sum of N+Q over all test cases will not exceed 500000

Warning: Large input/output.
