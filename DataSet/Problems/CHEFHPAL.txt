	Chef's birthday is coming soon! His friend Fehc is going to send him a string of length N as a gift. Knowing that Chef doesn't like palindromes, Fehc wants the longest palindromic substring to be as short as possible. The string should only contain the first A latin letters(e.g. let A=2, then this string only contains 'a' and 'b'). Please help Fehc and find such a string. If multiple solution exists, you can print any.

	Input
The first line of input is an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
T tests follow. For each test, there is a line containing two space-separated integers N and A.

	Output

	For each test, print a number L and a string s, separated by one space. L is equal to the length of longest palindromic substring of s, and s is the string that Fehc will give to Chef. You must minimize L, but in the case of multiple s's, any valid s is OK.

	Constraints
1≤T≤105
1≤N≤105
1≤A≤26
(sum of N in all test cases)≤105

	Subtask #1 (21 points):
N≤10.

	Subtask #2 (79 points):
original constraints.

Explanation

Example case 1. There are multiple solutions. For example, "abaaa" is also correct. Note that "abbaa" is not a correct solution, since "abba" is a palindromic substring of length 4, which is not optimal.
