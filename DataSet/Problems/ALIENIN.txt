Chef is the leader of Chef's Earth Defense Organization, and his mission is to counter aliens which are threatening the earth. According to information gathered by the organization, there are N alien spaceships (numbered 1 through N) planning to invade the earth. The i-th spaceship will appear on the radar at time Ci. Each spaceship needs D time to reach earth once it appears on the radar. 
Chef's organization owns a huge laser cannon which can destroy one spaceship in one shot. However, once the cannon is used once it needs some amount of cool-down time in order to be used again (first shot doesn't require cool-down time before it is used). This cool-down time, however, is configurable. It has to be set before the first shot, and cannot be changed after that. If Chef sets a lower cool-down time, that would increase the energy consumed by the cannon, and vice-versa - the higher the cool-down time, the lower the energy consumed.
This might be a long battle, and Chef wants to use as little energy as possible. So Chef wants to maximize the cool-down time while still being able to destroy all spaceships before any of them arrive on earth. In particular, the i-th spaceship should be shot between the times Ci and Ci+D (both end points inclusive).
Input:

The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers N and D. 
The second line contains N space-separated integers C1,C2,…,CN.

Output:
For each test case, print a single line containing one real number― the maximum cool-down time possible. Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error of the answer does not exceed 10−6.
