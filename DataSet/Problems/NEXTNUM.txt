 The Head Chef has received his id from the Association of Byteland . He wants to know the numerical rank of his number among the numbers that can be formed by the exact same digits ( i.e. among numbers having same number of 0's , 1's ... 9's as his id ) .  Note that id's can start with 0 . Given a number, find the rank of the number .


Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
 Each test case contains a single integer N denoting the id the chef has received .
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the given test case . 
Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10000
1 ≤ number of digits in N ≤ 18


                        Sample Input 1
                        





2
276

2
6


Explanation
Example case 1.The numbers that can be formed with one '2' ; one '7' and one '6' in increasing order are : 
267 
276 
627
