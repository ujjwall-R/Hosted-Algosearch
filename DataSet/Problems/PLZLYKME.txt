    In a far away dystopian world, the measure of the quality of a person’s life is the numbers of likes he gets for an article about their life. For a person to stay alive, he has to acquire at least L number of likes before D days pass.


    People in this world employ various techniques to increase the number of likes. One of the famous ones is to dis-like and re-like their own article once per day. On doing so you can assume that the number of likes for the post increase by a constant factor C.


So if one starts with S likes on Day-1, he would have D2 = S + C * S likes on Day-2,    D3 = D2 + D2 * C on Day-3 etc. You are to answer if the person would survive at the end of Day-D or not.


Input


 


    First line contains a single positive integer T denoting the number of test cases. The following T lines represent a test case each. Each test case contains 4 space-separated integers L, D, S and C.


Output


 


For each test case, print a single line containing “ALIVE AND KICKING” if the person would live, otherwise print, “DEAD AND ROTTING”.


Constraints


1 <= T <= 10001 <= L <= 10000000001 <= D <= 10000000001 <= S <= 10000000001 <= C <= 1000000000

                        Sample Input 1
                        





2
5 1 5 1
10 2 2 2



                        Sample Output 1
                        





ALIVE AND KICKING
DEAD AND ROTTING


Explanation
                    In the first case by the end of Day-1 we would be having S that is 5 number of likes, as it is ? L, the answer is ALIVE AND KICKING.
In the second case, D2 =S + C*S, therefore D2 = 2 + 2 * 2 = 6, as 6 is less than 10, the answer is DEAD AND ROTTING.
