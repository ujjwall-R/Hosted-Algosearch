Print the Kth character of the concatenated string. It is assured that given value of K will be valid i.e. there will be a Kth character. Can you help Pari out with this?
Note We have distinct substrings here, i.e. if string is aa, it's distinct substrings are a and aa.
 
Input
First line will contain a number T i.e. number of test cases. 
First line of each test case will contain a string containing characters (a-z)  and second line will contain a number K.
 
Output
Print Kth  character ( the string is 1 indexed )
 
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 5
1 ≤ length ≤ 105
K will be an appropriate integer.

 
Example
Input:
1
dbac
3

Output:
c


 
Explanation
The substrings when arranged in lexicographic order are as follows :
 a, ac, b, ba, bac, c, d, db, dba, dbac 

On concatenating them, we get :
 aacbbabaccddbdbadbac

The third character in this string is c and hence the answer.
