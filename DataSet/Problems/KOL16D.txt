There are nm men living in a town. They have  nh horses, each capable of carrying only one man at a time. All the men are supposed to attend a dinner party d km away from their house. They should start their journey together and reach destination in minimum time. Speed of each man is vm km/hour whereas speed of each horse (with or without somebody on back) is vh km/hour. You need to find the minimum time required to complete the journey? For simplicity you can assume the following things:
 
No time is needed in riding a horse or getting down from a horse.
The horses are very well trained to execute any instruction given to it.
No time is needed for changing the direction of horse or man.
The town and the dinner party location can be considered as two different points and all people and horses travel along the straight line connecting these two points.

Constraints

d (0 < d ≤ 10000)
nm (1 < nm ≤ 1000)
nh (0 < nh ≤ 1000)
vm (0 < vm ≤ 20)
vh (0 < vh ≤ 50)

Input
Each input set consists of  five integers d, nm, nh, vm,  vh in a new line. Input ends with five 0s in a line. There will be at max 105+1 lines in the input
Output
For each line of input except the last one produce one line of output. This line should print a fraction p by q, in p/q form. This denotes the minimum possible reaching time of all men. Here p and q must be relative prime.
