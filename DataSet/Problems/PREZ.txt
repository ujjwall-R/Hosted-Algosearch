You are given a string SS of length NN, which consists of digits from 00 to 9. You can apply the following operation to the string:

Choose an integer L with 1≤L≤N and apply Si=(Si+1)mod10 for each 1≤i≤L.

For example, if S=39590, then choosing L=3 and applying the operation yields the string S=406_90.
The prefix of string S of length l(1≤l≤∣S∣) is string S1S2…Sl. A prefix of length l is called good if S1=0,S2=0,…,Sl=0. Find the length of the longest good prefix that can be obtained in string S by applying the given operation maximum K times.
Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow:
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N,K.
The second line of each test case contains the string S.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the length of the longest good prefix that can be obtained in string S by applying the given operation maximum K times.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤N≤105
0≤K≤109
∣S∣=N
S contains digits from 0 to 9
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅105.

Explanation
Test case 1: There is no way to obtain zeros on the prefix of the string S=380 by applying the given operation maximum 5 times.
Test case 2: The optimal strategy is: choose L=2 and apply the operation twice, resulting in S=500, then choose L=1 and apply the operation 5 times, resulting in S=000.
Test case 4: One of the possible sequence of operations is the following:

Choose L=5 and apply the operation thrice, resulting in S=01045.
Choose L=2 and apply the operation 9 times, resulting in S=90045. 
Choose L=1 and apply the operation once, resulting in S=00045.
