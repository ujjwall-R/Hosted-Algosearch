In the new world, we also have a new system called Cybalphabit system.
The system assigns points to each Latin lowercase alphabet as follows:-
'a' is assigned 2020 , 'b' is assigned 2121, 'c' 2222 and so on. Thus, finally 'z' is assigned 225 points.
A Cyberstring is a sequence of lowercase Latin alphabets.
Now, the total score of a Cyberstring will be the sum of points of its characters.
You will be given two integers N and K. 
Construct a Cyberstring X of length N with total score K or print −1 if it is not possible to form the Cyberstring (X). 
If there are multiple answers, print any.
INPUT:

First line contains T, the number of test cases.
Each of the next T lines denotes a different test case :
The (i+1)th line denotes the ith test case, and contains two integers N and K, the length of the string that is to be constructed, and the score of the string respectively. 

OUTPUT:

For each test case, provide the output on a different line.
Output the required string X, if one exists, otherwise output −1.

Constraints:-

1≤T≤105
1≤n≤105
1≤k≤5∗107

The sum of n over all test cases is less than 105

4
2 2
2 5
4 5
3 2



                        Sample Output 1
                        





aa
ac
baaa
-1


Explanation
In the first test case, n=2 and k=2. So,we have to construct a string of length 2 with total score 2. It can be easily seen that the only possible string is "aa". Its total score will be equal to 20+20=2.
In the second case, "ac" will have score 20+22=5. Obviously, "ca" will also have the same score and is also a possible answer.
In the fourth test case, it can be shown that there is no possible string which satisfies the conditions.
