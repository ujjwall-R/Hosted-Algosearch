You are given an array A with N integers. You have to tell Chef whether this array is closed under multiplication. 
We say that an array is closed under multiplication if, for all sequences 1≤S1<S2<⋯<Sk≤N,  there exists 1≤x≤N such that AS1⋅AS2⋅⋯⋅ASk=Ax. 
Output 1 if it is closed, and 0 otherwise.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer - N
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers - the ith of which is Ai

Output Format
For each test case, output the answer on a new line. Output 1 if A is closed under multiplication, and 0 otherwise. 
Constraints

1≤T,N≤105
−109≤Ai≤109
The sum of N across all test cases does not exceed 106

Explanation
Test case 1: [1,0,3] is closed under multiplication.
A1⋅A2=1⋅0=0=A2
A1⋅A2⋅A3=1⋅0⋅3=0=A2
A1⋅A3=1⋅3=3=A3
A2⋅A3=0⋅3=0=A2
Therefore, the answer for the first test case is 1.
Test case 2: [1,−1,−1] is closed under multiplication.
A1⋅A2=1⋅−1=−1=A2
A1⋅A2⋅A3=1⋅−1⋅−1=1=A1
A1⋅A3=1⋅−1=−1=A2
A2⋅A3=−1⋅−1=1=A1
Therefore, the answer for the second test case is 1.
Test case 3: A2⋅A3=3⋅3=9 is not present in the array. Therefore, [1,3,3] is not closed under multiplication, and the answer is 0.
