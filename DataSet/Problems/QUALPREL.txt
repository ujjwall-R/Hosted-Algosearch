Snackdown 2019 is coming! There are two rounds (round A and round B) after the qualification round. From both of them, teams can qualify to the pre-elimination round. According to the rules, in each of these two rounds, teams are sorted in descending order by their score and each team with a score greater or equal to the score of the team at the K=1500K=1500-th place advances to the pre-elimination round (this means it is possible to have more than KK qualified teams from each round in the case of one or more ties after the KK-th place).
Today, the organizers ask you to count the number of teams which would qualify for the pre-elimination round from round A for a given value of K (possibly different from 1500). They provided the scores of all teams to you; you should ensure that all teams scoring at least as many points as the K-th team qualify.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers S1,S2,…,SN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of qualified teams.
Constraints

1≤T≤1,000
1≤K≤N≤105
1≤Si≤109 for each valid i
the sum of N for all test cases does not exceed 106

Example Input
