Let's call a string X interesting if it satisfies the following conditions:

X contains at least K pairwise distinct characters
for any two characters c1 and c2 which appear in X, the frequency (number of occurrences) of c1 in X is equal to the frequency of c2 in X

You are given a string S. Compute the number of interesting substrings of S. Two substrings are considered different if they are located at different positions in S.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a string S, followed by a space and and integer K.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of interesting substrings.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤|S|≤7,000
the sum of |S| in all test cases does not exceed 14,000
|S| contains only lowercase English letters
0≤K≤26

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (20 points): 1≤|S|≤100
Subtask #2 (20 points):

1≤|S|≤1,000
the sum of |S| in all test cases does not exceed 2,000

Subtask #3 (60 points): original constraints

                        Sample Input 1

Explanation
Example case 1: The interesting substrings are "ab", "ba", "ab", "bc", "abab" and "abc".
