Let's define the strength of a matrix as the number of distinct rows in it. Two rows a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an and b1,b2,…,bnb1,b2,…,bn are distinct if there is an index i such that ai≠bi.
You are given an integer matrix A with N rows (numbered 1 through N) and M columns (numbered 1 through M). A submatrix of A is formed as the intersection of rows r1 through r2 and columns c1 through c2 for any r1≤r2,c1≤c2. Find the sum of the strengths of all submatrices of A.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and M.
N lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤N), the i-th of these lines contains M space-separated integers Ai,1,Ai,2,…,Ai,M.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the sum of strengths of all the submatrices.
Constraints

1≤N⋅M≤500,000
1≤Ai,j≤109 for each valid i,j

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (20 points): 1≤N⋅M≤1,000
Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints
