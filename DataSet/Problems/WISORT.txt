Willow, a 3 years old genius, thought that sorting is based on the last digit of a number. His comparison process is if the last digit of an integer AA is smaller than the last digit of another integer BB ,then AA<BB. And if the last digit of two integers is same then he checks the previous one and this way the comparison continues.
That means, if the digits of an integer A is represented as  a1,a2…an and another integer B as  b1,b2…bm (n and m not necessary to be equal), A will be smaller than B if there is an i such that Ai < Bi and for each valid j > i, Aj = Bj.
For example,

If A=123 , B=521 then A > B.
If A = 521 , B = 518 then A < B

Willow is trying to sort N numbers in ascending order in his process. Can you help him?
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
First line of each testcase contains of a single line of input, one integer N - number of integers. 
-Then N line contains N integers X1,X2,…,XN

Output Format
For p-th testcase, first line will be "Case p:"(Don't put a space after this statement or it may cause WA) and then print the numbers in N line after sorting by Willow's rule.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
2≤N≤104
0≤Xi≤104
