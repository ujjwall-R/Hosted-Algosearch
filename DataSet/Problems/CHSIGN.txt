You are given a sequence of integers A1,A2,…,AN.
You should choose an arbitrary (possibly empty) subsequence of A and multiply each element of this subsequence by −1. The resulting sequence should satisfy the following condition: the sum of elements of any contiguous subsequence with length greater than 1 is strictly positive.
You should minimise the sum of elements of the resulting sequence. Find one such sequence with the minimum possible sum.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BN. For each valid i, Bi must be equal to either Ai (the sign of this element did not change) or −Ai (the sign of this element changed).
If there is more than one answer, you may output any one.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
2≤N≤105
1≤Ai≤109 for each valid i
the sum of N for all test cases does not exceed 5⋅105

Explanation
Example case 1: If we change only the sign of A3, we get a sequence {4,3,−1,2} with sum 8. This sequence is valid because the sums of all its contiguous subsequences with length >1 are positive. (For example, the sum of elements of the contiguous subsequence {A3,A4} equals −1+2=1>0.)
There are only two valid sequences {4,3,−1,2} and {4,3,1,2} with sums 8 and 10 respectively, so this sequence has the smallest possible sum.
For instance, the sequence {4,−3,1,2} isn't valid, because the sum of {A2,A3,A4} equals −3+1+2=0≤0.
