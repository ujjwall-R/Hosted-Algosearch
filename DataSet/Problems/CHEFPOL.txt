Chef likes stereometry a lot. Recently he learned about polyhedrons. During his assignments, he found a problem which he couldn't solve. Can you please help him in solving the problem?


You are given a convex polyhedron. Each face of polyhedron is a regular polygon. All polyhedral angles are equal. You have to find number of different ways to paint all the faces of the polyhedron in one of the C colors. Note that two painting of the polyhedron are said to be same, if one can be reached from other by a sequence of rotations or mirror reflections of the polyhedron. As this value could be large, output it by modulo 109+7.

Input
There is a single test case.
First line of the input contains two positive integers - N (number faces of the polyhedron) and C (number of possible colors) 
Next N lines contain information about the faces of polyhedron: 
First number of each line contains an integer ki denoting number of faces adjacent to i-th face. Next ki integers in the same line denote the faces adjacent to i-th face. 
Output
Output a single integer in a line denoting number of ways to color polyhedron in different ways modulo 109+7

Constraints

4 ≤ N ≤ 25
1 ≤ C ≤ 109

Subtasks

Subtask 1: Polyhedron is regular. Points - 20
Subtask 2: Original constraints. Points - 80
