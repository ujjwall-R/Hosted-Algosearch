However, they got stuck in a very complicated problem and is trying to figure out the method.
Chef has got two array (Lets suppose, we denote them as A and B) of length N, containing  single digit numbers only. 
Chef needs to combine the i-th element of array -A and B and find the greatest among the two combinations (two digit number formed by joining the digits).  
Help Chef !
Input: 

- First line will contain T, number of test cases. 
- Each T lines contains of a single line of input, the number N - number of digits.
- The next two lines contains N space-separated integers (Let's denote it X) ---the digits in ( 0 - 9) range 
Output: 
For each test case, print the newly formed  N two digit numbers in a space - separated format 
Constraints:
- 1≤T≤1000 
- 1≤N≤105 
- 0≤X≤9 
Sample Input: 
2 
5 
1 2 3 4 5 
3 2 1 4 5 
6 
9 0 1 2 3 6 
4 4 5 3 2 1 
Sample Output: 
31 22 31 44 55 
94 40 51 32 32 61 
Explanation 
Example case I : 1 2 3 4 5 combined with 3 2 1 4 5 
Forms the array 31 22 31 44 55 since 31>13, 22=22, 31>13, 44=44, 55=55
