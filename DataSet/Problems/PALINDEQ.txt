For two strings A and B with the same length N, we will say that they are equivalent if the following rule holds: For each pair of integers l and r (1≤l≤r≤N), the substring of A between the l-th and r-th character (inclusive) is a palindrome if and only if the substring of B between the l-th and r-th character (inclusive) is a palindrome.
You are given a string S with length N. Find the number of sets P⊂{1,2,…,N} such that there is a character c and a string X which is equivalent to S and satisfies Xp=c for each p∈P. Since the answer may be large, compute it modulo 998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single string S with length N.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of subsets of characters that can be equal to each other in some string equivalent to S, modulo 998,244,353.
Constraints

1≤T≤1,000
1≤N≤2,000
S contains only lowercase Latin letters
