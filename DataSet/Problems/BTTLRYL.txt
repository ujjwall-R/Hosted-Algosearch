Chef invented a new game named Quick Battle Royale. NN people play the game. One or more rounds are played until all players except one are eliminated. In each round:

Let there be xx non-eliminated players at the start of the round. Let's number them 11 through x.
First, each of these players chooses an integer between 1 and x inclusive. For each valid i, let's denote the integer chosen by the i-th player by pi. In addition, each player is not allowed to choose pi=i. Under these conditions, all players choose uniformly randomly and independently.
Then, the elimination process starts. For each i from 1 to x, in this order:
if the player i is currently still in the game, the player pi is eliminated from the game immediately
if the player i was already eliminated from the game in this round, nothing happens

Note that it is impossible for all players to be eliminated and in each round, at least one player is eliminated.
For example, a game for N=4 could look like this:

Round 1: The players choose p1=3, p2=4, p3=2, p4=2. For i=1, since player 1 is still in the game, player pi=3 is eliminated. For i=2, since player 2 is also in the game, player pi=4 is eliminated. Since the players 3 and 4 are eliminated, nothing more happens.
Round 2: Two players remain. The only choice they have is p1=2 and p2=1. For i=1, since player 1 is still in the game, player pi=2 gets eliminated. For i=2, player 2 is eliminated, so nothing happens.

Now there is one player left, so the game ends. It lasted 2 rounds.
You have to find the expected value of the number of rounds the game will last. It can be shown that the expected number of rounds can be written as a fraction pq, where p and q are positive integers and q is coprime with 109+7. You have to compute p⋅q−1 modulo 109+7, where q−1 is the multiplicative inverse of q modulo 109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of players at the start of the game.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer p⋅q−1 modulo 109+7.

Explanation
Example case 3: The answer is 32 modulo (109+7). The following cases can happen in the first round (with equal probabilities):
    - p=[2,1,1], game lasts 1 round
    - p=[2,1,2], game lasts 2 rounds
    - p=[2,3,1], game lasts 1 round 
    - p=[2,3,2], game lasts 2 rounds
    - p=[3,1,1], game lasts 1 round
    - p=[3,1,2], game lasts 1 round
    - p=[3,3,1], game lasts 2 rounds
    - p=[3,3,2], game lasts 2 rounds
Example case 4: The answer is 3518 modulo (109+7).
