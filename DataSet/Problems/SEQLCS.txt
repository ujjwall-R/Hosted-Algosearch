Chef has a sequence A consisting of N integers each lying between 1 and K, both inclusive. Now he wants to construct another sequence B of the same length also containing integers between 1 and K (again, both inclusive). Find out in how many ways he can construct the sequence B, such that the length of Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)  of A and B is exactly L. As the answer could be large, print it modulo 109 + 7.

Input
The first line of the input contains T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains two lines: 

The first line of each test case contains three space separated integers N, K, and L.
The second line contains N space separated integers A1, A2, ... AN. 

Output
For each test case output the number of ways to construct B as described above. Output the result modulo 109 + 7.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N,K ≤ 16 
1 ≤ L ≤ N 
The sequence A consists of integers between 1 and K (both inclusive).

2 2 1
1 2
3 3 2
1 2 2



                        Sample Output 1

11


Explanation

First Example : There are total three possible valid sequences B : [1, 1], [2, 2] and [2, 1]. LCS of these sequences with sequence A is equal to 1. Note that [1, 2] is not a valid sequence as LCS of this and sequence A is equal to 2. 


Second Example: The 11 ways are: [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [1, 2, 3],  [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 2], [2, 2, 1],  [2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 3, 2],  [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 2].

Note
Two sequences of B are considered different if there is at least one position which contains different numbers in the sequences.
