Killjee is trying to unlock a treasure. The key to the treasure is encrypted using a string S and Q queries. In each query, you need to find the K-th letter of a hidden string which is formed from the string S.
To form the hidden string, you should sort all substrings of S in lexicographical order and concatenate them. For example, if S = "abc", the hidden string would be "aababcbbcc". (See the sample explanation for details.)
In each query, the value of K is encoded in the following way:

You're given two integers P and M.
Let's define G as the sum of ASCII values of answers to all previous queries (therefore, G = 0 for the first query).
The value of K for the current query is ( P ·  G ) % M + 1, where % denotes the modulo operator.


Input

The first line of the input contains a single string S.
The second line contains a single integer Q.
Q lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers P and M.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one character — the K-th letter of the hidden string.
Constraints

1 ≤ |S| ≤ 2 · 105
1 ≤ Q ≤ 2 · 105
1 ≤ K,M ≤ length of hidden string
1 ≤ P ≤ 109
S will consist only of lowercase English letters

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (5 points): 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 50
Subtask #2 (15 points):

1 ≤ |S| ≤ 2000
1 ≤ Q ≤ 25000


Subtask #3 (20 points): 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10
Subtask #4 (60 points): original constraints

                        Sample Input 1
                        





abc
3
1 1
2 3
5 6



                        Sample Output 1
                        





a
b
a


Explanation
The substrings of S are "a", "b", "c", "ab", "abc", "bc". The lexicographical order of these strings is "a", "ab", "abc", "b", "bc", "c", so the hidden string is "a"+"ab"+"abc"+"b"+"bc"+"c" = "aababcbbcc".
For query 1, G = 0, so K = ( P · G ) % M + 1 = ( 1 · 0 ) % 1 + 1 = 1. The 1-st character of the hidden string is 'a'. We add the ASCII value of 'a' (97) to G.
For query 2, G = 97, so K = ( 2 · 97 ) % 3 + 1 = 3. The 3-rd character of the hidden string is 'b'. We add the ASCII value of 'b' (98) to G.
For query 3, G = 195, so K = ( 5 · 195 ) % 6 + 1 = 4. The 4-th character of the hidden string is 'a'. We add the ASCII value of 'a' (97) to G.
