Monica has a crush on Ross's friend and wants to go out with him. But he is a very geeky person and wants Monica to solve his Word Game for going out. The game contains a string SS consisting of uppercase Latin letters (′A′−′Z′)(′A′−′Z′). Now Monica is given N words(A1,A2,...,An) arranged vertically one below the other.   
The rules of the game are:  

She can swap two consecutive letters of any word Ai.For example, if word Ai is "word", she can change it to "owrd" by swapping "w" and "o" or she can change it to "wrod" by swapping "r" and  "o". She can use swapping in a word any number of times including zero.  
She cannot swap letters of two different words.  
Using rule 1 and 2, she has to make string S by using the first letter of each word Ai staring from i=1 to i=n without changing the order of words and without skipping any word ie. letter Si should be the first letter of Ai.  

Tell whether or not she will be able to make the given string S in the game.  
Input:
The first line of the input contains T, the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a string S. The second line of each test case contains an integer N. Each of the next N lines contains a single string Ai.  
Output:
For each test case output a single word in each line, "YES" if possible else "NO".  
Constraints

1≤T≤10 
1≤N≤105 
1≤|S|≤105 
1≤|Ai|≤105 
All letters in the strings are uppercase latin letter (′A′−′Z′).  
Sum of |S| and |Ai| over all test cases does not exceed 2∗106 

Sample Input:
2
LIKE
4
LEFT
PIN
KEYS
HELLO
LIKE
3
LEFT
KEYS
HELLO

Sample Output:
YES
NO

EXPLANATION:
For the first test case, one possible arrangement will be:  
LEFT
IPN
KEYS
EHLLO

The first letters in order from 1 to 4 will be L,I,K,E respectively. So we will get our string.
For the second test case, no possible arrangement is there as there are not enough strings as required.
