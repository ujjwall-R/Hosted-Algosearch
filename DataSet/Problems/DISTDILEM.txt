You are given an array AA of NN integers. You can do the following two types of operations any (possibly zero) number of times:

Pick two indices i and j (1≤i,j≤|A|,i≠j). Change Aj:=Aj+Ai and remove the ith element from the array.
Pick an index i (1≤i≤|A|). Split Ai into two positive integers X and Y such that X+Y=Ai. Remove the ith element from the array and append elements X and Y to the array.

Find the maximum number of distinct elements present in the array after performing any number of operations of the above two types.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the size of the array.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each test case, output the maximum number of distinct elements present in the array after performing any number of operations of the above two types.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
2≤N≤1000
1≤Ai≤105

Explanation

Test case 1: The maximum number of distinct elements that can be achieved by performing some finite number of operations on the given array is 3. Some examples of the final array are:

[1,2,4] : Perform no operation on the given array.
[1,2,1,3] : Perform operation 2. Choose i=3. Here, A3=4. Break it as X=1 and Y=3. On removing A3 and appending X and Y, we get [1,2,1,3]. This array has 3  distinct elements.
Test case 2: The maximum number of distinct elements that can be achieved by performing some finite number of operations on the given array is 3. Some examples of the final array are:

[1,1,3,4] : Perform no operation on the given array.
[1,1,3,2,2] : Perform operation 2. Choose i=4. Here, A4=4. Break it as X=2 and Y=2. On removing A4 and appending X and Y, we get [1,1,3,2,2]. This array has 3  distinct elements.
[2,3,4] : Perform operation 1. Choose i=1 and j=2. On changing A2:=A1+A2=1+1=2 and removing A1, we get [2,3,4]. This array has 3  distinct elements.
