A geyser has a capacity of XX litres of water and a bucket has a capacity of YY litres of water.
One person requires exactly 2 buckets of water to take a bath. Find the maximum number of people that can take bath using water from one completely filled geyser..
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers X,Y.

Output Format
For each test case, output the maximum number of people that can take bath.

Explanation
Test Case 1: One bucket has a capacity of 6 litres. This means that one person requires 2⋅6=12 litres of water to take a bath. Since this is less than the total water present in geyser, 0 people can take bath.
Test Case 2: One bucket has a capacity of 1 litre. This means that one person requires 2⋅1=2 litres of water to take a bath. The total amount of water present in geyser is 25 litres. Thus, 12 people can take bath. Note that 1 litre water would remain unused in the geyser.
Test Case 3: One bucket has a capacity of 10 litres. This means that one person requires 2⋅10=20 litres of water to take a bath. The total amount of water present in geyser is 100 litres. Thus, 5 people can take bath. Note that 0 litres of water would remain unused in the geyser after this.
