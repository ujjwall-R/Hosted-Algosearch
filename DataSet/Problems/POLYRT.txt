Let's define a function P(x,y)=(x−y)2. For given real numbers a and b, let's define a polynomial Qa,b(x)=P(P(P(x,a),a−b),x−b).
Next, let's define a function F(a,b):

If Qa,b(x) has no real roots, F(a,b)=0.
Otherwise, let r be the largest real root of Qa,b(x).
If r is rational, it can be represented by a fraction r=pq, where p and q are coprime integers and q>0. Then, F(a,b)=p+q.
If r is irrational, it can be proved that in this case, it can be represented in the form r=p+√zq, where p, q and z are integers, q>0 and z>0. Choose the representation with the smallest value of q (it is guaranteed to be unique in this case). Then, F(a,b)=p+z+q.

You are given a sequence of integers c1,c2,…,cN. Find ∑Ni=1∑Nj=1F(ci,cj).
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers c1,c2,…,cN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the sum of F(ci,cj).
Constraints

1≤T≤20
1≤N≤2⋅105
0≤ci≤2⋅105 for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105

Example Input
3
1 
0
2
3 0
5
3 2 2 0 6

Example Output
2
29
193

Explanation
Example case 1: Q0,0(x)=x4−x, so the largest real root is r=11, F(0,0)=1+1=2 and the answer is 2.
Example case 2:

Q0,0(x) has r=2, so F(0,0)=1+1=2
Q0,3(x) has no real roots, so F(0,3)=0
Q3,0(x) has r=7+√132, so F(3,0)=7+13+2=22
Q3,3(x) has r=4, so F(3,3)=4+1=5

The answer is 2+0+22+5=29.
