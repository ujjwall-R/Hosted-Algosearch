You are given a grid with N rows and M columns, where each cell contains either '0' or '1'.
You may perform the following operation up to K times: choose two different cells and swap the values in them. Find the largest possible side length of a square subgrid which contains only '0'-s after performing these operations.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T, total number of testcases.
Each testcase contains N+1 lines of input.
The first line contains three space-separated integers N, M and K.
N lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains a single string with length M describing the i-th row of the grid.

Output
For each testcase, print a single line containing one integer ― the largest side length of a square subgrid containing only '0'-s.
Constraints

1≤T≤2000
1≤N,M≤1000
0≤K≤N∗M
Sum of N∗M over all tests is atmost 3∗106
Each string contains only characters '0' and '1'

Example Input

11111
10001
10001
10001
11111
3 7 1

1100011

Example Output

3

Explanation
Case 1: Since all the '0'-s in the grid already form a square with side length 3, no swaps are required.
Case 2: If we could swap the values in pairs of cells (0,1), (0,6) and (2,1), (2,4), we would get a square with side length 3 using 2 swaps. But since the maximum possible number of swaps is 1, the answer cannot be greater than 2.
Case 3: We can swap the values in pairs of cells (0,1), (0,6) and (2,1), (2,4). Then, we get a square with side length 3 using 2 swaps.
