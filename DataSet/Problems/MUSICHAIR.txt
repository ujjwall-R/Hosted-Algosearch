Initially they decide a number KK and with each passing round they remove exactly K chairs. Hence, in each round exactly K players are eliminated. The game stops when less than or exactly K players remain in the game.
Now, Chef wants to figure out for how many possible values of K there will be exactly one winner in the game.
Input Format

The first line contains T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contain N - the number of friends in the game.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line a integer that denotes the number of values of K for which there will be exactly one winner.
