You are given two matrices AA and BB, each with RR rows (numbered 11 through R) and C columns (numbered 1 through C). Let's denote an element of A or B in row i and column j by Ai,j or Bi,j respectively.
You are also given an integer X. You may perform the following operation on A any number of times:

Choose an integer v.
Choose X consecutive elements of A, either in the same row or in the same column.
Add v to each of the chosen elements of A.

Determine whether it is possible to change A to B in a finite number of operations.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers R, C and X.
R lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains C space-separated integers Ai,1,Ai,2,…,Ai,C.
R more lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains C space-separated integers Bi,1,Bi,2,…,Bi,C.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Yes" if there is a sequence of operations that changes the matrix A to B, or "No" if such a sequence of operations does not exist.
Constraints

1≤T≤103
2≤R,C≤103
2≤X≤min(R,C)
|Ai,j|,|Bi,j|≤109 for each valid i,j
the sum of R over all test cases does not exceed 103
the sum of C over all test cases does not exceed 103

Explanation
Example case 1: We can add −1 to both elements in row 1 and add −1 to both elements in column 2.    
Example case 2: After any operation, the sum of elements of A remains even. However, the sum of elements of B is odd, so A cannot be changed to B.
