Watson gives an array A of N integers A1, A2, ..., AN to Sherlock. He wants Sherlock to reorganize the array in a way such that no two adjacent numbers differ by more than 1.
Formally, if reorganized array is B1, B2, ..., BN, then the condition that | Bi - Bi + 1 | ≤ 1, for all 1 ≤ i < N(where |x| denotes the absolute value of x) should be met.
Sherlock is not sure that a solution exists, so he asks you.
Input
First line contains T, number of test cases. Each test case consists of N in one line followed by N integers in next line denoting A1, A2, ..., AN.
Output
For each test case, output in one line YES or NO denoting if array A can be reorganized in required way or not.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ Ai ≤  109
Sum of N over all test cases  ≤ 2*105
