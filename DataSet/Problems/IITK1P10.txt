 

You are given a rooted tree with N nodes. Tree is rooted at node 1. Each node of the tree contains some value. Initially value of each node will be given.


You are given Q queries. Queries can be of two types, type U and type Q.

 Type U: This query is represented by U x v, which means that you
	have to add value v to node x. 
 Type Q: This query is represented by Q x, which means that you
	have to output number of nodes in the subtree rooted at node x having value equal to zero. 

Input

First line of the input contains two space separated integers N and Q.


For next N - 1 lines, each line contains two space separated integers u, v
denoting that there is an edge between u and v in the tree. It is guaranteed that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ N, u != v.
It is also guaranteed that no edge is repeated in the input.


Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the initial weight of each node in order, 1 to N. Weights will be between -10^9 to 10^9 (both inclusive).


For next Q lines, each line contains a query of either type U or type Q.

Output

For each query of type Q, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to answer of the query.

Constraints

1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 10^5
For query of type U, -10^9 ≤ v ≤ 10^9
For query of type U and V, 1 ≤ x ≤ N
