An integer xx is said to be a Perfect Power if there exists positive integers aa and bb (i.e aa, and bb should be ≥1≥1) such that x=ab+1x=ab+1.
Given an integer n, find the closest Perfect Power to n. If there are multiple Perfect Powers equidistant from n and as close as possible to n, find the smallest one.
More formally, find the smallest integer x such that x is a Perfect Power and |n−x|≤|n−y| over all Perfect Powers y.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer n.

Output Format
For each test case, print in a separate line, the smallest x such that x is a perfect power and |n−x| is minimum.

Explanation
Test case 1: n=7, 8=23 is a perfect power, but 6 is not, so the minimum difference obtainable is 1 when x=8.
Test case 2: n=10, 9=32 is a perfect power, but 11 is not, so the minimum difference obtainable is 1 when x=9.
Test case 3: n=26, 25=52 is a perfect power, 27=33 is also a perfect power. Both x=25 and x=27 give the minimum difference obtainable which is 1. The smallest of them is 25.
Test case 4: n=242, 243=35 is a perfect power but 241 is not, so the answer is 243.
Test case 5: 128=27 is closest to 129.
Test case 6: 394857628993920400=6283769802 is the closest to 394857629456789876.
Test case 7: 353872815358410000=243904 is the closest to 353872815358409997.
