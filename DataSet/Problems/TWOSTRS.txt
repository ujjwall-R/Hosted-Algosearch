In Chefland, each citizen has their own personal string. Chef is no exception. Recently, his string broke and he went to a shop to get a new one.
There are two strings in the shop: AA and BB. Chef may choose any substring AsAs of AA (possibly empty) and any substring Bs of B (also possibly empty). Then, the shop assistant cuts these substrings out and sells a single string C=As+Bs (here, + denotes string concatenation) to Chef. For example, if A is "aba" and B is "cde", then some of the strings Chef can buy are "ba", "bac", "bacd", "ae", "d", "acde", "aba", "cde" or "abacde".
Chef has seen a lot of strings in his life and he liked exactly N of them (numbered 1 through N). For each valid i, the i-th of these strings is denoted by Si and according to Chef, it has a beauty bi. Let's denote the number of substrings of C that are equal to Si by cnti(C). If Chef buys a string C, he says that the pleasure he gets from this string is ∑Ni=1cnti(C)⋅bi.
What is the maximum possible pleasure Chef can get from a string he buys in the shop?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single string A.
The second line contains a single string B.
The third line contains a single integer N.
The following N lines describe Chef's favourite strings. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains a string Si, followed by a space and an integer bi.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum pleasure.

13


Explanation
Example case 1: Chef can buy the string C = "tech" + "echef" = "techechef". In this string C, one substring is "chef", there are no substrings "code" and two substrings are "eche". Chef's pleasure in this case is 1⋅3+0⋅1+2⋅5=13, which is the maximum possible pleasure.
