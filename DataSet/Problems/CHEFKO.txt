Chef has a difficult problem to solve. He has NN segments [l1,r1],[l2,r2],…,[lN,rN][l1,r1],[l2,r2],…,[lN,rN] on the x-axis. A K-subset of these N segments consists of any K of these segments. For each K-subset, consider the common intersection of all the K segments, i.e. the set of points which belong to each of the K segments. The intersection of segments is also a segment; the length of a segment [l,r] is r−l. Chef is asking you to find the maximum of lengths of the common intersections in all K-subsets.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
N lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤N), the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers li and ri.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum length of a common intersection.
Constraints

1≤T≤1,000
1≤K≤N≤105
1≤li≤ri≤109
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅105

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (50 points): the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 104
Subtask #2 (50 points): original constraints
Example Input
1
3 2
1 6
2 4
3 6

Example Output
3

Explanation
Example case 1: A 2-subset is a pair of segments. The common intersections of all pairs are:

for the first and second segment, the intersection is the segment [2,4] with length 2
for the second and third segment, the intersection is the segment [3,4] with length 1
for the first and third segment, the intersection is the segment [3,6] with length 3
