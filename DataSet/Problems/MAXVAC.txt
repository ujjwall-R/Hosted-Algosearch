You are given Chef's calendar for the next NN days, defined as a binary string SS of length NN where Si=0Si=0 means that Chef has a holiday on the ith day from now, and Si=1 means that Chef has to work on that day. 
Chef wants to plan his vacations. For each vacation, Chef needs X consecutive holidays in his calendar. Obviously, he can only go on one vacation at a time.
Chef can take at most one extra holiday. That is, he can flip at most one digit in S from 1 to 0. If he does this optimally, what is the maximum number of vacations that he can go on?
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and X.
The second line of each test case contains a binary string S of length N — Chef's schedule.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the answer — the maximum number of vacations Chef can take if he takes at most one more extra holiday.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤2⋅105
1≤X≤N
The sum of N across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105

Explanation
Test Case 1: Chef can flip the 3rd digit to make his calendar 0000001. This allows him to take 3 vacations in the first 6 days. 
Test Case 2: Chef can flip the 3rd digit to make his calendar 1000. This allows him to take one vacation using the last 3 days.
Test Case 3: Regardless of whether Chef flips the 3rd digit or not, he can take at most 2 vacations.
