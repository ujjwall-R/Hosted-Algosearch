Given an array aa of nn integers. You need to swap adjacent numbers exactly kk times. The goal is to minimise the number of inversions after exactly k swaps.
An inversion is a pair (i,j) such that i<j and ai>aj
Input

The first line contains an integer T indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, there are two lines in total. 
The first line contains two space separated integers - n and k.
The second line contains n space separated integers, the ith of which is ai.

Output
Output T lines in total. Each line should start with "Case #: " and followed by the minimum inversions after swaps. Here "#" is the number of the test case starting from 1.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
2≤n≤100000
0≤k≤1000000
1≤ai≤n

Example Input
3
3 3
3 2 1
3 1
1 2 3
3 2
1 2 3

Example Output:
Case 1: 0
Case 2: 1
Case 3: 0

Explanation
Test Case 1: (32)1 --> 231 --> 2(31) --> 213 --> (21)3 --> 123
Test Case 2: (12)3 --> 213.
