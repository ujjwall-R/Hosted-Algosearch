The World Chess Championship 20222022 is about to start. 1414 Classical games will be played between Chef and Carlsen in the championship, where each game has one of three outcomes — it can be won by Carlsen, won by Chef, or it can be a draw. The winner of a game gets 22 points, and the loser gets 00 points. If it’s a draw, both players get 11 point each.
The total prize pool of the championship is 100⋅X100⋅X. At end of the 1414 Classical games, if one player has strictly more points than the other, he is declared the champion and gets 60⋅X60⋅X as his prize money, and the loser gets 40⋅X40⋅X.
If the total points are tied, then the defending champion Carlsen is declared the winner. However, if this happens, the winner gets only 55⋅X55⋅X, and the loser gets 45⋅X45⋅X.
Given the results of all the 1414 games, output the prize money that Carlsen receives.
The results are given as a string of length 1414 consisting of the characters C, N, and D.

C denotes a victory by Carlsen.
N denotes a victory by Chef.
D denotes a draw.

Explanation
Test case 11: Since Carlsen won all the games, he will be crowned the champion and will get 60⋅X60⋅X as the prize money which is 60⋅100=600060⋅100=6000
Test case 22: Carlsen won 77 games and drew 77, so his score is 2⋅7+1⋅7=212⋅7+1⋅7=21. Chef lost 7 games and drew 7, so his score is 0⋅7+1⋅7=7. Since Carlsen has more points, he will be crowned the champion and will get 60⋅X as the prize money which is 60⋅400=24000
Test case 3: Carlsen and Chef both end up with 14 points. So, Carlsen is declared the winner, but because the points were tied, he receives 55⋅X=55⋅30=1650 in prize money.
