Given a sequence AA of length NN, the weight of this sequence is defined as
weight(A)=N∑i=1i⋅Ai
Given an integer N, we pick a permutation A of [1,2…N] uniformly at random. What is the expected weight of this permutation?
It can be shown that the answer can be represented as PQ where P and Q are coprime integers and Q≠0(mod998244353). Print the value of P⋅Q−1 modulo 998244353.
Input Format

First line of the input contains T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single integer on a single line N.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single integer, the answer to the test case.
Constraints

Explanation

Test case 1: There is only one permutation of [1] which is [1] and the weight of this permutation is equal to 1. So, the expected weight is equal to 1.
Test case 2: There are 2 permutations of [1,2] namely
[1,2] with weight equal to 5.
[2,1] with weight equal to 4.

So, the expected weight is equal to 5+42!=92.

Test case 3:
There are 6 permutations of [1,2,3] namely
[1,2,3] with weight equal to 14.
[1,3,2] with weight equal to 13.
[2,1,3] with weight equal to 13.
[2,3,1] with weight equal to 11.
[3,1,2] with weight equal to 11.
[3,2,1] with weight equal to 10.

So, the expected weight is equal to 14+13+13+11+11+103!=12.
