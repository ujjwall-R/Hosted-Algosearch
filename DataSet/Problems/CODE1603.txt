Kamaldeep came across a new way to represent a string.This is done by writing each segment of identical characters as the character and the length of the segment.
For example the string str = "XXXZZZZZPP" can be represented as [ ('X', 3), ('Z', 5), ('P', 2) ].
In this notation,two consecutive pairs cannot have same character. For example [('T', 4), ('T', 3)] is invalid and its correct representation is [('T', 7)]. Kamaldeep has written down a string in given representation, and he wants to count the number of sub-strings (a segment of consecutive characters) of the original string that are palindromes.
Recall that a palindrome is a non-empty string that reads the same backward as forward. Two sub-strings are considered to be different if they have different lengths or start at different positions in the original string.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer M denoting the number of test cases. The description of M test cases follows.
Each test case gives a string in the above representation. The first line of each test case contains an integer N, the number of (character, integer) pairs in the given representation. Each of the next N lines contains a single character, followed by a space, followed by a positive integer, the kth line being the kth pair in the list..
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the corresponding answer.

Constraints

1 ≤ M ≤ 10^4
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5

Each character is an upper-case Latin character, i.e. 'A' through 'Z'.
The length of the original string does not exceed 1,000,000,000 (10^9)
The sum of the Ns over all test cases will not exceed 1,000,000 (10^6)
Example
Input:
4
3
L 3
Z 2
A 3
3
O 2
B 1
A 2
1
S 11
2
I 4
P 2

Output:
15
7
66
13
