You are given a set SS, which is a subset of {1,2,…,N}{1,2,…,N}.
Consider a permutation P1,P2,…,PNP1,P2,…,PN of the integers 1 through N. The cost of this permutation is the number of indices i>1 such that Pi is divisible by Pi−1 and PiPi−1∈S.
For each k between 0 and N−1 (inclusive), find the number of permutations with cost k. Since these numbers may be large, compute them modulo 998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N.
The second line contains a binary string T with length N. For each valid i, the i-th character of T is '1' if i∈S or '0' otherwise.

Output
Print a single line containing N space-separated integers. For each k (0≤k<N), the k+1-th of these integers should be the number of permutations with cost k, modulo 998,244,353.
Constraints

1≤N≤40
T contains only characters '0' and '1'
