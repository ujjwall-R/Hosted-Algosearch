Problem Statement
Bored of reading statements and problem related with Cyborg, Geno and his friends? So am I. The problem statement goes as follows.
You are given 2 string, A and B. You need to support 3 type of operations on these strings.

1 x y: Change the xth character in the string A to y.
2 x y: Change the xth character in the string B to y.
3 l r: Report the number of substrings of B that have the same character set as the substring of A from index l to r i.e. A[l:r].


Assume 1-based indexing in the whole problem. By character set of a string S, we mean the set of characters (in sorted order) which appear in S atleast once. For example: The character set of S = "aettmeeb" is {a, b, e, m, t}
Input section
The first line contains T, the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first 2 lines of each testcase contains 2 strings, A and B on a separate line. The next line contains Q, the number of queries. Each of the next Q lines contains 3 integers, denoting the queries to be supported as stated in the problem above.
It is guaranteed that all the queries indices are within the range of the string length.
Output section
For each query of type 3, print the required answer to the problem.
Input constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ |A|, |B|, Q ≤ 100000, where |S| = length of string S
Both A and B consists of lowercase characters {a, b, c, ...., r, s, t} only.
Sum of |A| over all test cases ≤ 200000
Sum of |B| over all test cases ≤ 200000
Sum of Q over all test cases ≤ 200000

Sample Input
2
abde
cabb
4
1 3 b
3 1 1
3 2 4
3 1 3
eee
eeeee
1
3 1 3

Sample Output
1
0
2
15

Explanation
The below explanation is for test case 1.

The string A becomes abbe.
The substrings of B having the character set as {a} is a.
There are no substrings of B having the character set as {b, e} as there is no character e in the string B.
The substrings of B having the character set as {a, b} are ab, abb.


For the test case 2, all the substrings of B satisfy the condition.
