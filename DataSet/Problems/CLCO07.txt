 
While developing Apps for Artificial Intelligence, Arush has to use specific type of strings (words) called Class C strings. 
All the strings have been classified into 3 classes:
Class A : A sequence of letters that read the same forward and backward.
Class B : A string of class B can be converted to class A type by changing exactly one letter to a different letter. 
For Example, CAT is class B type, since it can be changed to class A by either changing "C" to "T" or "T" to "C".
Note that "SEES" is not a class B type, since changing one letter would not make it to a class A type.
Class C : A string of class C is one that is formed by concatenating 2 strings of class B together. 
For example, BATMAN is a class C type, since BAT and MAN both belong to class B type.

Given a list of words, help Arush determine which words belong to class C type and which do not.
 
Input

Input will consist of all uppercase words which will not be more than 25 characters in length.
The last word will be *END* which is not to be processed, it is just to mark the end of input.

 
Output

For each input, output "INPUT_STRING YES" if it is a class C type otherwise "INPUT_STRING NO" (without quotes).

 
Constraints

1 ≤  Length of each word  ≤ 25

 
Example
Input:
BATMAN
SUPERMAN
*END*

Output:
BATMAN YES
SUPERMAN NO

 
Explanation
Example case : Already Explained Above.
