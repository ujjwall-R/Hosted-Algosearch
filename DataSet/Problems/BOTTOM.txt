It is known that in regular dice, the sum of opposite faces is 77.
A regular dice is rolled and you are given the value XX showing on the top face. Determine the value on the bottom face.
Input Format

The first line will contain T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only of each test case contains a single integer X - the value on the top face.

Output Format
For each test case, output the value on the bottom face.
Constraints

1≤T≤6
1≤X≤6

Explanation
Test case-1: The value on the top face is 3. Therefore, the value on the bottom face is 4 because 3+4=7.
Test case-2: The value on the top face is 1. Therefore, the value on the bottom face is 6 because 1+6=7.
Test case-3: The value on the top face is 6. Therefore, the value on the bottom face is 1 because 6+1=7.
