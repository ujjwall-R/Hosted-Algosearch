There are N people waiting in a queue at ATM. The ith person in the queue has a power level equal to Ai (1≤Ai≤N). The following process happens every second till the queue is not empty.

The person in front of the queue uses the ATM and then leaves the queue.
After the first step, if the queue is empty, the process stops. Otherwise, for each person from left to right (except for the first person in the queue), if the person has a strictly greater power level than the person in front of him, he will overtake the person in front, i.e. their positions get swapped. Note that the overtaking happens one after the other from left to right, i.e. state of the queue changes after every overtake.

For each person, find the time at which they will use the ATM.
Note: Please refer to the explanation section for a simulation of one such scenario.
Input Format

First line of input contains T, the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
First line of each test case contains N, the number of people in the queue.
Second line of each test case contains N positive integers Ai, the power level of ith person.

Output Format
For each test case, print a line containing N numbers where ith number is equal to the time at which ith person uses the ATM.
Constraints

1≤T≤2⋅104
1≤N≤2⋅105
1≤Ai≤N
Sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅105.

Explanation
Test Case 1:
Initially, let the order of people in the queue is [1,2,3,4,5], and their power levels are 2,3,4,1 and  5 respectively.

During the 1st second, 1 uses the ATM and leaves. The order of the people in the queue will be [2,3,4,5] after 1 leaves. Now people start overtaking (2nd step of the process). Since 3 is the 2nd person in the queue and 2 is in front of him and A2 < A3, 3 will overtake 2. The order of the people in the queue will become [3,2,4,5]. Now 4 is the 3rd person in the queue and 2 is in front of him. But A2 > A4, so there will be no overtaking here. Finally, 5 is the 4th person and 4 is in front of him. And since A4 < A5, 5 will overtake 4 and The order of the people in the queue will be [3,2,5,4] after the 1st second.
During the 2nd second, 3 is in front of the queue. He will use the ATM and leave. The order of the people in the queue will become [2,5,4]. Since 5 is the 2nd person in the queue with 2 in front of him and A2 < A5, 5 will overtake 2 and the order of the people in the queue becomes [5,2,4]. Now 4 is the 3rd person in the queue. But A2 > A4, so 4 can't overtake 2. By the end of 2nd second, the order of people in the queue is [5,2,4].
During the 3rd second, 5 is in front of the queue. He will use the ATM and leave. After this, the queue will be 2,4. And since A2 > A4, there will be no overtaking.
During the 4th second, 2 uses the ATM and leaves. 
During the 5th second, 4 uses the ATM and leaves.

Hence, 1,2,3,4 and 5 use the ATM at 1,4,2,5,3 second, respectively.
