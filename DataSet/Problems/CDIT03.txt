Agent Chef 
RAW (Indian spy agency) hacked into a terrorist computer which according to 
their intelligence contains information about future terrorist attacks. But there is
a problem that the computer uses a particular encryption technique to safeguard its 
data. That computer gives a token, which consists of space separated elements. These 
elements are numbers each ranging from 0 to 9. It is known this encryption can be broken 
by constructing a number with the given elements in the order given by the computer and
adding the reverse of that number to the original number. The sum so obtained is the key
to break the encryption. This mission to construct the decryption device has been given to
agent Chef. Help the Chef construct this device. 
Input Format: 
First line contains an integer T, representing no. of test cases.
For each of test cases:
First line contains an integer N, representing size of token.
Second line contains N elements of token that are space separated.

Output Format: 
For each test case output will be a token of space separated elements.
Constraints: 
T <= 20
1 <= N <= 1000 
Each element will be a number from 0 to 9
Examples: 
Input
2
6
2 1 4 2 6 7
5
1 3 2 8 0
Output
9 7 6 6 7 9
2 1 5 1 1
Explanation:
First line gives T=2 (2 test cases). 6 in next line means there will be 6 elements in the 
token and the next line has the token itself. Output is 9 7 6 6 7 9 as 214267+762412=976679.
 Similarly, 13280+08231=21511 for the second test case.
