You are given a binary string SS. You can perform the following operations on SS:

Flip: Pick an index i (1≤i≤|S|) and flip the i-th character (i.e change 1 to 0 or 0 to 1). For e.g. 011_001→010_001
Compress: Pick any non-empty substring consisting of the same character and replace it with a single occurrence of that character. For e.g. 1001111_10→1001_10

You want to make all the characters of the binary string equal (i.e. either all characters are 0 or all characters are 1). Find the minimum number of operations required to do so.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string S.

Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer - the minimum number of operations required to make all the characters of S equal.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤|S|≤106
S is a binary string.
It is guaranteed that the sum of |S| over all test cases does not exceed 106.

Explanation
In the first test case,

1000_11compress→10_11
10_11flip→11_11

In the second test case,

1110_011flip→1111_011
11110_11flip→11111_11

In the third test case,

00010_1110flip→00011_1110
00011111_0compress→0001_0
0001_0flip→0000_0
