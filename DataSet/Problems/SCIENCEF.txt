This is a story of city Chef Land. The transport network of the city contains V intersections and E bidirectional roads. The intersections are numbered from 1 to V. Every intersection can be reached from every other intersection. The road Ei has length Wi. The Mayor is organizing a Science Festival at intersection F.
The N students studying in School of Chef Land have requested their principal to send them to the Festival. Each student lives at an intersection (student i lives at intersection Pi). The school is present at intersection S.
The principle wants to send randomly some of the N students to the Science Festival. He writes their names on an Official List and gives it to the bus driver to arrange the transport. The probability that name of ith student is written on the list is equal to the percentage marks Mi he receives in Science.
The driver's job is to drive the school bus from school S to Festival F picking up all the students mentioned on the official list. Since all the students are super excited to visit the festival, therefore if the bus goes through the intersection they are living on, they will on board the bus even if their name was not written on the official list by the principal.
We know that the bus driver doesn’t like talkative people in the bus. Also, for every student i we know his talkativeness value Ti. The talkativeness of the trip done by driver from S to F is defined as the product of Talkativeness of all the students that got into the bus.
For a trip: The driver faces a cost(Trip) = Length(Trip) + (Talkativeness(Trip) modulo 109+7 ). Therefore the driver always chooses the path with minimum cost. He also charges this amount from the principal.
If the driver receives an empty list he cancels the trip and the cost is 0.
The principal wants to know the expected value of money paid by him to the driver for a single trip.
Input

The first line contains 4 space separated integers V, E, S, F.
The second line contains a single integer N.
ith line of the next N lines contains 3 integers each Pi Ti  Mi.
The next E lines contains 3 integers each u v w denoting a road of length w between intersections u and v.

Output
Print a single integer (A*B-1) mod 109+7 where A/B is the expected money paid by the principal and gcd(A, B) = 1. B-1 is the modular inverse of B modulo 109+7

Expected cost =(0+3+3+5+5+5+5+7)/8 = 33/8 = 33 * 8-1 mod 109+7= 33*125000001  mod 109+7 = 125000005
