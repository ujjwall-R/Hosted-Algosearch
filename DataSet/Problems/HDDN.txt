We know that there is a hidden sequence A1,A2,…,AN which contains only integers between 1 and K inclusive. We have acquired M triplets (X1,Y1,Z1),(X2,Y2,Z2),…,(XM,YM,ZM). A very reliable source has given us intel that for each valid i, the Yi-th occurrence of the integer Xi in the sequence A is AZi, i.e. AZi=Xi and there are Yi−1 indices j<Zi such that Aj=Xi.
Find any sequence A consistent with this information or determine that no such sequence exists.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, K and M.
M lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤M), the i-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers Xi,Yi and Zi.

Output
For each test case:

If no valid sequence exists, print a single line containing the string "No".
Otherwise, print two lines.
The first of these lines should contain the string "Yes".
The second line should contain N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Constraints

1≤T≤5⋅105
1≤N,K,M≤5⋅105
1≤Xi≤K for each valid i
1≤Yi,Zi≤N for each valid i
all triplets are pairwise distinct
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅105
the sum of K over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅105
the sum of M over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅105
