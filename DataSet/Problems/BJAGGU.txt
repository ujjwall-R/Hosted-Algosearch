Bheem is playing a game with Jaggu. Jaggu gives Bheem NN strings and asked him to find the length of the shortest consecutive subarray, such that the characters of the string in the given subarray can be used to form the word given by Jaggu. He ask Q such questions, each question consist of a word. Bheem is not able to solve these queries as he gives his laddus to NIT topper. So he want you to calculate the minimum length of the subarray. If not possible print −1.
Input:

First line will contain N, number of strings Jaggu gives to Bheem. 
Next N lines contains a string S.
The next line contains Q, number of questions Jaggu asks.
Next Q lines contains a string.  

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line, the minimum length of the subarray , such that the characters of the string in that range can be use to produce that word (ask by Jaggu).
If not any subarray possible , print −1.
Constraints

1≤N≤10000
2≤Q≤100
Sum of lenght of all the strings in input ≤ 100000
Sum of the lenth of all the strings in queries ≤ 100000 

Sample Input:
 3
 adew
 rdwq
 cgr
 2
 aw
 rrc

Sample Output:
 1
 2

EXPLANATION:
For first query:
String 1(adew) can be use to form the word(aw) , So min length = 1
For second query:
String 2-3 ( rdwg, cgr ) can be use to form the word ( rrc ) , So min length  = 2
