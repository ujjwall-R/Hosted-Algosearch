You are given a matrix AA of non-negative integers with NN rows (numbered 11 through NN) and N columns (numbered 1 through N). For each valid i and j, let's denote the element in the i-th row and j-th column by Ai,j.
You need to find a matrix B with N+1 rows and N+1 columns (numbered similarly) such that:

each element of this matrix is a digit between 0 and 9 (inclusive)
Ai,j=Bi,j+Bi+1,j+Bi,j+1+Bi+1,j+1 for each valid i,j

The matrix A is chosen in such a way that at least one solution exists. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N.
N lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains N space-separated integers Ai,1,Ai,2,…,Ai,N.

Output
Print N+1 lines. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines should contain N+1 characters Bi,1,Bi,2,…,Bi,N+1.
Constraints

1≤N≤100
for the matrix A, at least one valid matrix B exists

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (10 points): N≤5
Subtask #2 (90 points): original constraints
Example Input
2

24 28

Example Output
