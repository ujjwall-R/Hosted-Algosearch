PASS
FAIL
FAIL


Explanation
Test case 1: Chef gets 2 questions correct giving him 6 marks and since he got 3 questions incorrect so he faces a penalty of −3. So Chef's final score is 3 and the passing marks are also 3, so he passes the exam :)
Test case 2: Chef's total marks are 3 and since the passing marks are 4, Chef fails the test :(
Test case 3: Chef got all the problems wrong and thus his total score is −4. Since the passing marks are 0, Chef fails the exam :(
