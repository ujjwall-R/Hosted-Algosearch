Chef is stuck in the wavey world of polynomials. You are given all NN roots of a polynomial P(x)=∏Ni=1(x−ai). The roots are pairwise distinct integers, but they are not given in any particular order.
To help Chef escape, you should answer Q queries (numbered 1 through Q). For each valid i, in the i-th query, you are given an integer xi and you have to determine whether P(xi) is positive, negative or 0.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The second line contains N space-separated integers a1,a2,…,aN.
Q lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains a single integer xi describing the i-th query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing the string "POSITIVE", "NEGATIVE" or "0" (without quotes) describing the value of the polynomial for the i-th query.
Constraints

1≤N,Q≤2⋅105
|ai|≤109 for each valid i
a1,a2,…,aN are pairwise distinct
|xi|≤109 for each valid i

Explanation
The given polynomial is (x−1)⋅(x−3)⋅(x−5)⋅(x−100).
Query 1: x=−2. This means that P(−2)=(−2−1)⋅(−2−3)⋅(−2−5)⋅(−2−100)=(−3)⋅(−5)⋅(−7)⋅(−102)=10710>0. Thus, the answer is POSITIVE.
Query 2: x=2. This means that P(2)=(2−1)⋅(2−3)⋅(2−5)⋅(2−100)=(1)⋅(−1)⋅(−3)⋅(−98)=−294<0. Thus, the answer is NEGATIVE.
Query 3: x=4. This means that P(4)=(4−1)⋅(4−3)⋅(4−5)⋅(4−100)=(3)⋅(1)⋅(−1)⋅(−96)=288>0. Thus, the answer is POSITIVE.
Query 6: x=5. This means that P(5)=(5−1)⋅(5−3)⋅(5−5)⋅(5−100)=(4)⋅(2)⋅(0)⋅(−95)=0. Thus, the answer is 0.
