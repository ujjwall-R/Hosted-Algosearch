You are given a tree with N nodes, with each node numbered uniquely with 1..N.
Movement from a particular node to its parent(if exists) is the only allowed move and it costs 1 rupee. That is from any node U we can go to parent(U) in 1 rupee, parent(parent(U)) in 2 rupees, parent(parent(parent(U))) in 3 rupees etc.
We have Q queries of the form r, u, v and each query is interpreted as follows:

The tree is rooted at r
One person is standing at u and another one is standing at v.
Both of them want to meet at a common location with each one spending as minimum as possible.
The answer to the query is x y, where x is the minimum cost for the person standing initially at u and y is the minimum cost for the person standing initially at v to meet in a common location.

Input:

First line will contain two integers N and Q, the size of the tree and number of queries.
It is followed by N-1 lines with each line containing two space separated integers indicating an edge between the two nodes in the tree.
It is followed by Q lines, where each line has three space separated integers r u v, root of the tree, initial location of person 1 and initial location of person 2 respectively. 

Output:
For each query output two integers x and y in a new line, where x is the cost for person 1 and y is the cost for person 2 to reach the common point.
Constraints

1≤N,Q≤105
1≤Nodenumber≤N
1≤r,u,v≤N

Sample Input:
5 3
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
1 5 3
2 5 3
4 5 3

Sample Output:
2 1
1 2
1 2

EXPLANATION:
When tree is rooted at 1, it looks like
             1

            / \

          2   3

        /  \

      4     5

So the common point with minimum cost for node 5 and node 3 is node 1, so cost for person at node 5 is 2 and cost for person at node 3 is 1.
When tree is rooted at 4, it looks like
                     4

                    |

                    2

               /         \

        5                   1

                                  \

                                       3

So the common point with minimum cost for node 5 and node 3 is node 2, so cost for person at node 5 is 1 and cost for person at node 3 is 2.
