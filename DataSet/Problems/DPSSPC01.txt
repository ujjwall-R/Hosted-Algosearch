A factorial of a non-negative integer is defined as the product of all numbers from 11 to NN inclusive.
The factorial of NN is denoted by N!. By convention, 0!=1.
For example, 5!=5×4×3×2×1=120.
Your task is simple. You are given N!, where you have to find N. If multiple values exist for a single factorial, find the largest one.
It is guaranteed that a solution exists.
Input:

The first line will contain T - number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase consists of a single line of input: one integer N!. 

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line N as explained in the problem statement.
Constraints

1≤T≤30
1≤N!<1036

Subtasks

30 points : 1≤N!≤1000
70 points : original constraints.

Sample Input:
2
1

24
Sample Output:
1

4
EXPLANATION:
For N!=1, multiple solutions exist. N=1 satisfies the conditions.
For N!=24, N=4 because 4×3×2×1=24.
