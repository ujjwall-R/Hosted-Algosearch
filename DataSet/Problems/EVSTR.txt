An even sequence has the following property: each maximal contiguous subsequence which contains only equal integers (i.e. the same integer repeated a number of times) has an even length. In particular, the empty sequence is even. A subsequence is maximal if it is not contained in a larger contiguous subsequence which contains only equal integers.
Chef was given an integer sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN by his friend Mr. Z. He may perform the following operation any number of times: either delete an element of the current sequence (if it is non-empty) or insert an integer anywhere in the current sequence (possibly at the beginning or at the end).
Find the minimum number of operations needed to make the sequence even.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of operations.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤N≤2⋅105
1≤Ai≤N for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅106

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (10 points): N≤18
Subtask #2 (10 points): Ai≤Ai+1 for each valid i
Subtask #3 (20 points): N≤3,000
Subtask #4 (20 points): Ai≤26 for each valid i
Subtask #5 (40 points): original constraints

Explanation
Example case 1: Here are two ways to make the sequence even using 2 operations:

Delete the first element 1 and the only element 2, resulting in a sequence (1,1), which is even.
Delete the last element 1 and insert 2 at the end, resulting in a sequence (1,1,2,2), which is even.

It can be proved that one operation is not enough to make the initial sequence even.
