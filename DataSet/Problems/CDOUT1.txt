Rohan has decided to trade in Gold. But as he is just starting out, he can only buy one unit of gold and then sell it at a later date. This is unfair for Rohan. To make up for this restriction, Rohan is given the price of gold of N days into the future from today. Can you help Rohan maximize his profit?

Output
For each test case output a single integer which is the maximum profit he can make.
Constraints

1≤ T ≤1000 
0≤ N ≤10^6 
0≤ P[i] ≤10^6
