Chef was recently studying the Bitwise OR operation, and stumbled upon the following problem:
Let F(i)=1 | 2 | 3 | … | iF(i)=1 | 2 | 3 | … | i, where || denotes bitwise OR.
You are given an integer N. Find the number of distinct i such that 2≤i≤N and F(i)=F(i−1).
Input Format

The first line of input will contain an integer T — the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integer N.

Output Format
For each test case, output the number of distinct i such that 2≤i≤N and F(i)=F(i−1).
Constraints

1≤T≤105
2≤N≤109

Explanation
We have:
F(1)=1
F(2)=3
F(3)=3
F(4)=7
Test case 1: F(2)≠F(1). Hence the answer is 0. 
Test case 2: For i=3, F(i)=F(i−1). Hence the answer is 1.
Test case 3: For i=3, F(i)=F(i−1). For i=2,4, F(i)≠F(i−1). Hence the answer is 1.
