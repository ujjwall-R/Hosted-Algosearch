Lets define a beauty of subarray , as the sum of all the elements in it.
Given an array A and Q different queries of the form ind K, such that you have to divide the array (aind aind+1 …. an−1) into K contiguous subarrays such that the bitwise XOR of all the beauty of K subarrays is maximum considering each subarray is consisting of no more than L elements in it. 
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
The first line of each testcase consists of three space separated integers N Q and L.
The second line consists of N space separated not necessarily distinct integers a0 a1…..an−1.
Then Q lines follow for each testcase, consisting of query of type ind k.

Output Format
For each query, output in a single line answer i.e., maximum value of bitwise XOR of all the beauty of subarrays consisting of no more than L elements in each of them or print −1 if it is not possible.
