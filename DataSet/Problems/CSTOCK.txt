Test Case 2: The price of the stock after falling 7% will become 93, which is not in Chef's range of [94,100]. Hence, Chef will not buy the stock.
Test Case 3: The price of the stock after falling 17% will become 151.89, which is not in Chef's range of [152,172]. Hence, Chef will not buy the stock.
