The children in the school are to have their final results announced today! There are in total 1-N roll numbers of students.
The children have received their scores but are unhappy with the marks they received. So they flock around teacher A in large groups to increase their marks. While at the same time, another
teacher, Teacher B asks the students to say their marks. However, teacher B has a weird habit. She likes to note down the sum of the marks of the students in a range of roll numbers and notes down the average roll number in the range. 
Your task is to keep track of the marks of the students and also give teacher B the ceiling value of the current average marks of a range of roll numbers.
Note: Ceiling value refers to the upper box function. Ceiling value of 4.2 is 5. Ceiling value of 5.8 is 6.
Input:

First-line will contain NN, the number of children with roll numbers from 1 to N.
The next line contains NN space-separated integers M signifying the initial marks that the children received.
The next contains Q or the number of Queries that you will have to process.
The following Q lines contain the queries. Each query has 3 integers a,bandc.
if a is 0, then its a query of type 0 in which you will have to update the marks of a student with roll number b by c marks.
if a is 1, then its a query of type 1 in which you will have to give the ceiling value of the average marks of students from roll number b to c.

Output:
For every Query of type 1, you will have to print a single integer representing the ceiling value of the average marks of the range of roll numbers supplied in the query.
