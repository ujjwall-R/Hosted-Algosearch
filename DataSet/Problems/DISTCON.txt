The manhattan distance between two points P1(x1,y1)P1(x1,y1) and P2(x2,y2)P2(x2,y2) is given by d(P1,P2)=|x2−x1|+|y2−y1|d(P1,P2)=|x2−x1|+|y2−y1|.
In other words, manhattan distance is the minimum number of moves required to reach P2 from P1 if, in each move, you are allowed to travel one unit along the X-axis or one unit along the Y-axis.
You are given an integer D. Find four points (P1,P2,P3,P4) with integer coordinates, such that:

The absolute value of both X and Y coordinates of all points is at most 109.
The manhattan distance between any pair of points is D .
More formally, d(Pi,Pj)=D for all 1≤i<j≤4. 

If such set of points do not exist, print -1. If there are multiple solutions, you may print any.
Note: It is guaranteed that whenever there exists a solution, there exists one in which all points have coordinates with absolute values not more than 109.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, D - as per the problem statement.

Output Format

If there is no solution, print in a single line the integer -1.
Otherwise print 4 lines. The ith line, should contain two space separated integers, XiYi, the coordinates of the point Pi, such that 0≤|Xi|,|Yi|≤109.

Constraints

1≤D≤105

Explanation
The following sample output for this testcase is not correct, but is only provided to clarify the output format
The points in the solution are P1(0,1),P2(1,2),P3(2,3) and P4(3,4). d(P1,P2)=|0−1|+|1−2|=2 but d(P1,P3)=|0−2|+|1−3|=4.
As d(P1,P2)≠d(P1,P3), the solution is incorrect. 
A correct solution will satisfy d(P1,P2)=d(P1,P3)=d(P1,P4)=d(P2,P3)=d(P2,P4)=d(P3,P4).
A correct sample output is not provided so as to not reveal any hints about the solution.

-1


Explanation
You may verify that for D=1, there are no set of points P1,P2,P3,P4 as per the problem statement. This output is correct.
