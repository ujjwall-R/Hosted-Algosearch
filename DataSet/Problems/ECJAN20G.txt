Saitama finally got a date! However, his date, Fubuki,  was not impressed by him. She wanted to see how clever Saitama was.  Hence she asked him a question. 
Saitama was given a list of numbers by his date, let the list be N=[a1,a2,a3........an].N=[a1,a2,a3........an].
Saitama's task is to find out how many elements in the list is made up by combining other numbers from the list. He can combine a number A more than once to form number B. 
Your task is to help Saitama in his endeavour and help him count the number of numbers in the list which were formed by combining other numbers present in the list. 
Note: You cannot rearrange the digits of the number.
Input:

First-line will contain NN, the number of numbers in the list.
The next line contains N space-separated numbers a1,a2,a3,.....aN. 

Output:
For each test case, output in a single line the number of numbers in the list which were formed by combining other numbers present in the list.
Constraints

1≤N≤1000000
0≤ai≤1e+10

It is guaranteed that the sum of all lengths of a1 and N do not exceed 10^7
Sample Input:
    5
    1 11 123 2 23

Sample Output:
    2

EXPLANATION:
11  can be made with 1 and 1, 123 can be made from 1 and 23. The constituents of the other numbers are not present in the list.
