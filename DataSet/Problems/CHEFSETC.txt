Chef likes problems which using some math. Now he asks you to solve next one. You have 4 integers, Chef wondering is there non-empty subset which has sum equals 0.
Input
The first line of input contains T - number of test cases. 
Each of the next T lines containing four pairwise distinct integer numbers - a, b, c, d.
Output
For each test case output "Yes", if possible to get 0 by choosing non-empty subset of {a, b, c, d} with sum equal 0, or "No" in another case.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 103
-106 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ 106 


                        Sample Input 1
                        





3
1 2 0 3
1 2 4 -1
1 2 3 4



                        Sample Output 1
                        





Yes
Yes
No


Explanation
Example case 1. We can choose subset {0} 
Example case 2. We can choose subset {-1, 1}
