Chef wants to make a purchase. For this, he needs XX gold coins, but he has none at the moment.
Chef has NN fixed deposits, the ith of which is worth Ai coins. He wants to open the minimum number of these deposits so that he has at least X coins.
You have to tell Chef the minimum number of fixed deposits he must open in order to have X coins, or say that this is impossible.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers — N and X, as described in the statement.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers — the ith of which is Ai.

Output Format
For each test case, output one line containing the answer — the minimum number of FDs Chef must open to have at least X coins. If it is not possible for him to open FDs such that he has at least X coins, output −1.

Explanation
Test case 1: Chef can open the first and second FDs to get 4+3=7 coins, which is more than the 6 coins he needs. There are other combinations of two FDs giving at least 6 coins — for example, the first and third (for 4+5=9) and third and fourth (for 5+1=6), but there is no way to open only one FD and get 6 or more coins.
Test case 2: No matter which FDs Chef opens, he cannot have ≥15 coins, so the answer is −1 — even if he opens all of them, he will have only 1+5+3=9 coins.
Test case 3: Chef can open the first FD to obtain 10 coins, which is larger than the 5 coins he needs.
Test case 4: Chef can open the third and fourth FDs to get 3+4=7 coins, which is enough because he needs 7 coins.
