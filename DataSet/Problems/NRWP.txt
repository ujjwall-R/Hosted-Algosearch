Consider a grid with HH rows (numbered 11 through HH) and W columns (numbered 1 through W). Let's denote the value in a cell in row i and column j by hi,j. N particles (numbered 1 through N) are distributed in the cells in such a way that there is at most one particle in each cell. For each valid i, the i-th particle has a value pi and it is placed in the cell in row yi and column xi.
Let's denote the set of all particles by P and the set of all unordered pairs of particles that are located in side-adjacent cells by E. We define the value of the grid as
V=∑i∈Ppi⋅hyi,xi+∑(i,j)∈Epi⋅pj.
You are given the grid and the locations of all particles, but not their exact values ― only |p1|,|p2|,…,|pN|. Your task is to choose the sign of each value pi in such a way that the value V is maximum possible. Each sign may be chosen independently from all other signs.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers H, W and N.
H lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains W space-separated integers hi,1,hi,2,…,hi,W.
N more lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers yi, xi and |pi|.

Output
For each test case, print two lines.

The first of these lines should contain a single integer ― the maximum value of V.
The second line should contain N space-separated integers. For each valid i, the i-th of these integers should be 1 if you choose a positive sign for the value of the i-th particle (i.e. its value should be |pi|) or −1 if you choose a negative sign (i.e. its value should be −|pi|).

If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.
