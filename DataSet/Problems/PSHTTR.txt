There is a castle which can be described as an undirected tree with N vertices and N−1 edges. Each edge has a magic number C.
When a group of tourists visit the castle, they are interested in a path between vertices U and V. They think that an edge is interesting if its magic number is ≤K. The total attractiveness of the path is the xor of all interesting edges on it.
Given M groups of tourists, find the total attractiveness of the path for each group.
Input

The first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test case descriptions follow. 
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, denoting the number of vertices.
The next N−1 lines each contain three integers U, V and C, which denote an edge between vertices U and V with magical number C.
The next line contains a single integer M, which denotes the number of requests.
The next M lines contain information about the requests. Each line contains three integers U, V and K.

Output
For each request output a single integer in a separate line - the total attractiveness of the path.
