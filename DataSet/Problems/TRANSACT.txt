There are nn friends. The ithith friend has AiAi coins.  You are also given an integer R
Define a transaction as transfer of one coin from one friend to another. They can do as many transactions as they want under the constraint that:

For any ordered pair of friends i and j, the number of transactions from i to j doesn't exceed R

What is the maximum possible number of coins the friend with minimum coins can have in the end?
Please note that the number of coins held by a person can't go negative at any time in the process of transactions.
Input

First line will contain n and R.
Then second line contains n integers separated by a space, A1,A2,…,An.

Output

Constraints

1≤n≤105
1≤Ai≤109
1≤R≤103

Example Input
3 1
1 3 5

Example Output
