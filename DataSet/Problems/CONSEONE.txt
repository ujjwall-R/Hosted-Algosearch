Jon like numbers which is formed using a same decimal digit. He calls them Samedonic Number.
He is given a number N of D digits formed using at most 2 distinct decimal digits. He wants to make that number a Samedonic Number using the below operation any number of times.
-> In one operation he can choose a segment of same digits and change them to a segment of any specific decimal digit.
For e.g. He can choose a segment of 333 and change it into a segment of 444.
What is minimum number of such operations Jon needs, to make the number N a Samedonic Number?
A decimal digit can be any digit from 0 to 9.
NOTE: D is the number of digits of N. Take input carefully. 
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, one integer of D digits.

Output Format
For each testcase output the minimum number of such operations Jon needs.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤D≤106


                        Sample Input 1
                        





2
33433
111



                        Sample Output 1
                        





1
0


Explanation
First Case:
In one operation we can change 33433 to 33333, which is a Samedonic Number.
So, total 1 operation needed.
Second Case:
111 is already a Samedonic Number.
So, total 0 operation needed.
