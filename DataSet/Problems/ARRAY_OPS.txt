Given an array AA consisting of NN non-negative integers. 
You need to perform the following operation (N−1)(N−1) times:

Sort the array A in ascending order.
Let M be the current size of the array A. Replace the array A by [(A2−A1),(A3−A2),…,(AM−AM−1)]. Note that each time the operation is performed, the size of the array reduces by one.

Find the remaining element after (N−1) operations.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer T denoting number of test cases. The T test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the size of the array.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each test case, output single line: the remaining element after (N−1) operations.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤N≤105
0≤Ai≤1018
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

1
777


Explanation

Test case 1: The operations look like:
Operation 1: Sort the array. Now, A becomes [0,3,19,29]. Replace the array. Thus, A=[(3−0),(19−3),(29−19)]=[3,16,10].
Operation 2: Sort the array. Now, A becomes [3,10,16]. Replace the array. Thus, A=[(10−3),(16−10)]=[7,6].
Operation 3: Sort the array. Now, A becomes [6,7]. Replace the array. Thus, A=[(7−6)]=[1].

Thus, the remaining element after 3 operations is 1.

Test case 2: Since N=1, you don't need to perform any operation. The remaining element after 0 operations is 777.
