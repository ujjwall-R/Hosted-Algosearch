Abhishek was given a task by his teacher to find whether the two strings are
companion strings or not.


Two strings s1 and s2 are said to be companion strings if the number of distinct substrings of s1 and number of distinct substrings of s2 are equal. Also s1 and s2 need not to be of equal length.

Given two strings s1 and s2, print “Companion” if s1 and s2 are companion strings, else print “Non Companion”.
Input:

1st line contain string s1
2nd line contain string s2

Output:

Companion OR Non Companion

Constraints: 

1<=Length of string s1<=100
1<=Length of string s2<=100

Sample Input:
	 
abca
pqpqp

Sample Output:

Companion

Explanation:

abca has 9 distinct substrings a, b, c, ab, bc, ca, abc, bca, abca.
pqpqp also has 9 distinct substrings p, q, pq, qp, pqp, qpq, pqpq, qpqp, pqpqp. So they are companion strings.
