Chef is tired of solving boring math problems by hand. One of these problems is summing up the products of elements from each k-subset of the set [n]. Here, a k-subset is a subset containing exactly k elements and [n] refers to the set which contains all integers between 1 and n (inclusive). More formally:

Let’s denote this number by f(n, k). Note that f(n, 0) = 1.
Since calculating f(n, k) is too boring, Chef wants to know how the divisibility of f(n, k) by a given prime p depends on k. Specifically, for a fixed n, you should compute the number of ways to select k (0 ≤ k ≤ n) so that f(n, k) isn't divisible by p. After a while of thinking, Chef realized there might be too many ways to do that. Therefore, you should compute this number modulo 109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers n and p.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one number — the number of ways to select k, modulo 109+7.

Explanation
Example case 1: The values of f(4, k) are as follows:

f(4, 0) = 1
f(4, 1) = 1+2+3+4 = 10
f(4, 2) = 1·2+2·3+3·4+4·1+1·3+2·4 = 35
f(4, 3) = 1·2·3+2·3·4+1·3·4+1·2·4 = 50
f(4, 4) = 1·2·3·4 = 24

Only k = 0 and k = 2 give numbers indivisible by p = 2, so the answer is 2.
