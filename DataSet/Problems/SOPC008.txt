Cooper is trying to decipher the strange dust patterns in Murphy’s room.
He observes that there are two patterns repeating, and he decides to write them as binary strings having ‘a’ and ‘b’. He now obtains two strings of equal length N, where N is even. Now to process this, he needs to make both the strings palindromic, which he wants you to do. He thus gives you the strings.
You are given two strings of equal length N, where N is even. Every character in each string has only two possible characters, ‘a’ or ‘b’.
You have at most N−1 operations of the form x0 x1 x2. This means:

If x0=1, swap the xth1 and xth2 characters of string 1.
If x0=2, swap the xth1 character of string 1 and xth2 character of string 2.
If x0=3, swap the xth1 and xth2 character of string 2.

For example if the operation is 1 5 4, swap the 5th character of string 1 and the 4th character of string 1.
You either have to use these operations to make both the strings palindromic or report that such a transformation is not possible and conclude that the strange dust pattern did not mean anything.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains T, the number of test cases.
In each test case, the first line has N, the number of letters in each string.
The next two lines contain the two strings.

Constraints

1≤T≤100
2≤N≤50, N is even

Output Format

For each test case, print several lines.
If the transformation is not possible, print a line containing -1.
Else, print on the first line the number of needed operations.
In each of the next lines, print a sequence of integers x0 x1 x2.
Note that you do not have to minimize the number of operations.
If there are multiple solutions, you may print any.

Sample Input
2
6
aabaaa
baabba
6
aaaaaa
bbbbba

Sample Output
2
2 4 1
3 5 3
-1
