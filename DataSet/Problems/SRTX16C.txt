 
Jumping Jack is new to the Heroic Society.He is so obsessed with jumping that he can do it the whole day without getting tired
Jumping Jack likes challenges a lot, and he is challenged by the beautiful Cho Chang to jump a river.
Since Jumping Jack can't jump the river in a single leap, Cho Chang gave him N magical leaves which will float on water.
Jumping Jack arranged the leaves in a stright line on the water's surface.
The last leaf arraged by Jumping Jack represents the bank of the river. If Jumping Jack can reach the last leaf then it means that 
  can cross the river.

Jumping jack has three different style of jumping which are as follows:

Jump one step forward
Jump two steps forward 
Jump three steps forward 

But there's a twist in the game.Cho Chang unknowingly gave him some pseudo-magical leaves.
If Jumping Jack steps on any pseudo-magical leaf he will drown.
You are given the information about the leaves arranged by Jumping Jack in the form of an array A.
A[i] is Zero if the leaf is magical and One if it is pseudo-magical
Find out whether it is possible for Jumping Jack to cross the river or not,
if YES then the minimum leaps required by him to cross the river.
if NOthen print "Never Give Up" without quotes.
Note: Reaching the last leaf is considered as crossing the river. If Jumping Jack can't reach the last leaf then he can't cross the river
Initially Jumping Jack is standing on the first leaf.

 
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
   The description of T test cases follows.
   First line of each test case contains an integer N
   Second line contains N space separated integers denoting whether the leaf is magical(0) or pseudo-magical(1)
 
Output
For each test case output one single line the minimum number of leaps required to cross the river if it is possible.
  If it is not possible to cross the river then print "Never Give Up" without quotes
