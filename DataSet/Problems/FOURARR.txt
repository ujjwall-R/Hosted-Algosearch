You have been given an integer KK and four arrays AA, BB, C, and D with sizes SA, SB, SC and SD respectively.
Follow the given steps:

Pick four indices x, y, z, and w from arrays A, B, C, and D respectively. Note that (1≤x≤SA), (1≤y≤SB), (1≤z≤SC) and (1≤w≤SD).  
There are in total SA×SB×SC×SD ways to do the above step. For each way, write down the value of (Ax+By)×(Cz+Dw) on a board. 
Sort all the numbers written on the board in non-decreasing order. 

Find the Kth element written on the board.
Input Format

First line contains five integers SA, SB, SC, SD and K.
The second line contains SA space-separated integers A1,A2,...,ASA denoting the array A.
The third line contains SB space-separated integers B1,B2,...,BSB denoting the array B.
The fourth line contains SC space-separated integers C1,C2,...,CSC denoting the array C.
The fifth line contains SD space-separated integers D1,D2,...,DSD denoting the array D.

Output Format
For each test case, output the required number in a single line .

20


Explanation
After sorting the numbers on the board are in the following order {8,8,10,10,12,15,16,16,20,20,20,25}. So, the 10th number is 20.
