Mike likes strings. He is also interested in algorithms. A few days ago he discovered for himself a very nice problem:


You are given an AB-string S. You need to count the number of substrings of S, which have an equal number of 'A'-s and 'B'-s.


Do you know how to solve it? Good. Mike will make the problem a little bit more difficult for you.


You are given an ABC-string S. You need to count the number of substrings of S, which have an equal number of 'A'-s, 'B'-s and 'C'-s.


A string is called AB-string if it doesn't contain any symbols except 'A' or 'B'. A string is called ABC-string if it doesn't contain any symbols except 'A', 'B' or 'C'.

Input
 
The first line of the input contains an ABC-string S.
Output
Your output should contain the only integer, denoting the number of substrings of S, which have an equal number of 'A'-s, 'B'-s and 'C'-s.

The answer can go above a 32-bit integer. Please, use 64-bit integers for storing and processing data.
Constraints
1 ≤ |S| ≤  1 000 000; where |S| denotes the length of the given ABC-string.
Example
Input:
ABACABA

Output:
2

 
Explanation

In the example you should count S[2..4] = "BAC" and S[4..6] = "CAB".
