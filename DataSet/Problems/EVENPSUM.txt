You are given two positive integers A and B. Find the number of pairs of positive integers (X,Y) such that 1≤X≤A, 1≤Y≤B and X+Y is even.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers A and B.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of valid pairs.
