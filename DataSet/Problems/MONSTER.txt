Chef is playing a game named "Killing monsters". In this game, at the beginning, there are n monsters arranged in a row (numbered 0 through n-1 from left to right). The i-th monster initially has hi health points. A monster dies if its health points become ≤ 0.
Chef is going to perform q actions. For each action, Chef chooses two numbers x, y and shoots all living monsters whose index k satisfies k & x = k (& denotes the bitwise AND operator). Each monster he shoots loses y health points.
After each action, please help Chef determine the number of living monsters.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n denoting the number of monsters.
The second line contains n space-separated integers h0, h1, ..., hn-1 denoting the initial health of monsters.
The third line contains a single integer q denoting the number of actions.
q lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers x and y describing one action.

Output
For each action, print a single line containing one integer — the number of living monsters afterwards.
Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 217
