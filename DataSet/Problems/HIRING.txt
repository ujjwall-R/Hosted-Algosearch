Chef Shahhoud wants to hire new chefs for his restaurant. Shahhoud posted a job offer on Chef Rami's paper "Fast Food Times".
N candidates (numbered 1 through N) have applied for the job. There are M traits that define how good a chef is. You are given N strings S1,S2,…,SN describing the traits of the candidates. Each of these strings has length M. For each valid i and j, the j-th character of Si is '1' if the i-th chef has the j-th trait or '0' if this chef does not have this trait.
Shahhoud wants to choose a non-empty subsequence H (not necessarily contiguous) of the sequence (1,2,…,N) and hire all candidates from H. However, the sequence H must satisfy an additional condition: for any two consecutive elements of H (let's denote them by x and y), candidates x and y have no common traits, to prevent fights between them.
Now, Shahhoud is wondering: how many such valid subsequences exist? Find this number modulo 1,000,000,007 (109+7).
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.
N lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤N), the i-th of these lines contains a single string Si.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of valid subsequences modulo 1,000,000,007.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤M≤16
1≤N≤100,000
|Si|=M for each valid i
S1,S2,…,SM contain only characters '0' and '1'
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 500,000
