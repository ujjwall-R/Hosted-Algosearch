THE CROFTS GAME
Lara and Jonah were onto Siberia for the expedition of the divine source. The flight was of 9 hours. To kill the time, they both decided to play a game. The rules of the game are simple.
The game starts with two n-integer arrays, A and B, and is played by two players. (here Lara and Jonah)
Both Lara and Jonah play in alternating turns, with Lara always playing first. During each turn, the current player must choose an integer i, (such that 0 <= i <= n – 1). If the current player is Lara, then she receives A[i] points; if the current player is Jonah, then he receives B[i] points.
Each value of ‘i’ can be chosen only once, either by Lara or Jonah, not both. The game always ends after n moves.
The player with the maximum number of points wins.
TASK
Given the values of n, A, and B, can you determine the outcome of the game? 
Print ‘First’ if Lara will win, 
Print ‘Second’ if Jonah will win, 
Print 'Tie’ if they will tie. 
Assume both players always play optimally.
INPUT FORMAT:
The first line of input contains a single integer, TestCases, denoting the number of test cases. Each of the 3 subsequent lines describes a test case. A single test case is defined over the following three lines:
1. An integer, n, denoting the number of elements in arrays A and B.
2. n space-separated integers, A0, A1, A2, ……An-1, where each Ai describes the element at index i of array A.
3. n space-separated integers, B0, B1, B2, ……Bn-1, where each Bi describes the element at index i of array B.

CONSTRAINTS:
1 <= TestCases <= 10 
1 <= n <= 1000 
1 <= Ai, Bi <= 105 

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each test case, print one of the following predicted outcomes of the game on a new line:
Print ‘First’ if Lara will win, 
Print ‘Second’ if Jonah will win, 
Print ‘Tie’ if they will tie. 

INPUT:
3
3
1 3 4
5 3 1
2
1 1
1 1

2 2
3 3

OUTPUT:
First
Tie
Second


EXPLANATION:
TestCase 1:
 A = {1,3,4}, B = {5,3,1}. Lara and Jonah make the following n moves:
       1. Lara chooses i = 2 and receives 4 points.
       2. Jonah chooses i = 0 and receives 5 points. Note that Jonah will not choose i = 1, because this would
           cause Lara to win. 
       3. Lara chooses i = 1 (which is the only remaining move) and receives 3 points.

As all n = 3 moves have been made, the game ends. Lara's score is 7 points and Jonah's score is 5 points, so Lara is the winner and we print ‘First’ on a new line.

TestCase 2:
 A = {1,1}, B = {1,1}. Because both players will only make 1 move and all possible point values are 1, the players will end the game with equal scores. Thus, we print ‘Tie’ on a new line.

TestCase 3:
 A = {2,2}, B = {3,3}. Because both players will only make 1 move and all the possible point values for Jonah are greater than all the possible point values for Lara, Jonah will win the game. Thus, we print ‘Second’ on a new line.
