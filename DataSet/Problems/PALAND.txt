You are given an array AA consisting of NN integers. Calculate the number of ways to divide this array into subsegments, such that the sequence formed by taking bitwise AND in each segment of the partition is a palindrome.
More formally, consider a partition of the array into segments [L1,R1], [L2,R2], [L3,R3], …, [Lk,Rk] such that L1=1,L2=R1+1,L3=R2+1,…,Lk=Rk−1+1,Rk=N. Let's define Bi as AND on i-th segment: Bi=ALi∧…∧ARi, where x1∧x2∧…∧xt, denotes bitwise AND of numbers x1,…,xt.
A partition is palindromic if Bi=Bk+1−i for every 1≤i≤k. Your task is to calculate the number of palindromic partitions. Since this number can be large, calculate it modulo 998244353.
Input Format

The first line of input contains T — the number of test cases you need to solve.
The first line of each test case contains one integer N — the size of the array.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,…,AN — the elements of the array A.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the number of ways to partition A into subsegments, such that the bitwise AND of these segments form a palindrome.
Constraints

T≤1500
2≤N≤3000
Sum of N over all test cases is at most 3000.
0≤Ai<230

Explanation
Test case 1: The palindromic partitions are {[1,3]},{[1],[2,3]},{[1,2],[3]},{[1],[2],[3]}. To see why:

For {[1,3]}, B=[A1∧A2∧A3]=[1]
For {[1],[2,3]}, B=[A1,A2∧A3]=[1,1]
For {[1,2],[3]}, B=[A1∧A2,A3]=[1,1]
For {[1],[2],[3]}, B=[A1,A2,A3]=[1,1,1]

Clearly B is a palindrome in all 4 cases.
Test case 2: The only palindromic partition is {[1,4]}.
Test case 3: The palindromic partitions are {[1,3],[4,5]},{[1,3],[4],[5]},{[1,4],[5]},{[1,5]}.
