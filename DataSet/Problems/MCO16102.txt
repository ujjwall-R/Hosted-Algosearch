Now, for each segment of the array that contains no destroyed elements, Fluffy wants the numbers to be non-decreasing, i.e. each element is at most equal to the one following it. For example, [3, 4, 4, 5] is non-decreasing but [4, 6, 5] isn't. He needs your help to find out how many ways are there to choose the set of integers to destroy (which may be empty or the entire set) such that all segments containing no destroyed elements are non-decreasing. Since the answer might be too large, he is just interested in the remainder of the answer when divided by 1000000007. (109 + 7)
 
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer n, the number of integers of the array. The next line contains n space-seperated integers, a1, a2, ..., an, denoting the elements of the array.
Output
Output a single integer, the number of ways to destroy a set of integers such that all segments without a destroyed element are non-decreasing.
Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 100000
1 ≤ ai ≤ 109

Subtasks

Subtask 1 (37 points) : 1 ≤ n ≤ 20
Subtask 2 (63 points) : Original Constraints

 
Example
Input:
3
4 6 3

Output:
6

 
Explanation
Example case 1. There are 6 sets of integers that can be removed, and they are {3}, {6}, {3, 4}, {3, 6}, {4, 6}, {3, 4, 6}. Note that {6} can be removed because Fluffy will have two segments [4] and [3], which are both non-decreasing. Note that {} (the empty set, which means we remove none of the integers) can't be removed because [4, 6, 3] is not non-decreasing (6 > 3)
