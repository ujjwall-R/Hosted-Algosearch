Note: For the problem KPERM, we have observed that PYPY3 performs better than Python3.
You are given integers NN, RR and K. Consider all permutations of the integers 1 through N with exactly R inversions. Find the K-th lexicographically smallest among these permutations.
Notes:

The number of inversions in a permutation P1,P2,…,PN is the number of pairs of integers (i,j) such that 1≤i<j≤N and Pi>Pj.
A permutation A1,A2,…,AN is lexicographically smaller than a permutation B1,B2,…,BN if there is an index i (1≤i≤N) such that Ai<Bi and for each valid j<i, Aj=Bj.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, R and K.

Output
For each test case:

If the lexicographically K-th smallest permutation with R inversions does not exist, print a single line containing the integer −1.
Otherwise, print a single line containing N space-separated integers ― the lexicographically K-th smallest permutation with R inversions.

Constraints

1≤T≤2,000
1≤N≤500
0≤R≤200,000
1≤K≤1018

Explanation
Example case 1: There are two permutations with 1 inversion: [1,3,2] and [2,1,3]. The first permutation is lexicographically smaller than the second permutation.
