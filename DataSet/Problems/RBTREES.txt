In a red-blue tree, each vertex is either red or blue and adjacent vertices always have different colours.
You are given a tree with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN). It is not necessarily a red-blue tree, but its vertices are still coloured red and blue. You may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero): choose two adjacent vertices and swap their colours.
Find the smallest number of operations required to transform the tree into a red-blue tree or determine that it is impossible.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
N−1 lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting that vertices u and v are connected by an edge.
The last line contains a string S with length N. For each valid i, the i-th character of this string is either '0' if the i-th vertex is initially red or '1' if it is initially blue.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest number of operations or −1 if it is impossible to transform the tree into a red-blue tree.
Constraints

1≤T≤100 
1≤N≤100,000 
1≤u,v≤N 
S contains only characters '0' and '1'
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106

Explanation
Example case 1: We can perform the following operations:

Swap the colours of vertices 1 and 3; the string of colours becomes "1000010".
Swap the colours of vertices 1 and 2; the string of colours becomes "0100010".
Swap the colours of vertices 6 and 3; the string of colours becomes "0110000", so the tree is a red-blue tree.
