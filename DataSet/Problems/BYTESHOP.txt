In how many ways can shoppers purchase R items in all such that everyone buys atleast one item, and every item is brought by atleast one person ? A shopper can purchase any particular item at most once.


Input :
The first line contains the number of test cases T. T lines follow containing 3 integers: N,M and R. 
(1 <= T <= 100. 1 <= N,M <= 200. 1 <= R <= N * M)


Output :
Output T lines, one for each test case, containing the output for the corresponding test case.
Output all values modulo 1000000007
