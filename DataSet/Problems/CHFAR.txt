Chef has a sequence of positive integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. He has only one question for you: is it possible to change at most KK elements of this sequence to arbitrary positive integers in such a way that the condition
A21+A22+⋯+A2N≤A1+A2+⋯+ANA21+A22+⋯+A2N≤A1+A2+⋯+AN
holds?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K. 
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to satisfy the given condition or "NO" otherwise.
Constraints

1≤T≤1,000
1≤K≤N≤104
1≤Ai≤10 for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints
Example Input
1
2 2
1 2

Example Output
YES

Explanation
Example case 1: It is possible to change A2 to 1. This gives A=[1,1], for which the given condition holds, so the answer is "YES".
