Chef has some numbers. His girlfriend Chefina feels good when chef gives her a particular pattern number also called as Armstrong number.
Armstrong number is a number whose sum of its all individual digit raise to the power of the number of digit in that number is equal to that number itself
eg.. 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 (153 is an Armstrong number)
     1634 = 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 (1634 is an Armstrong number)
