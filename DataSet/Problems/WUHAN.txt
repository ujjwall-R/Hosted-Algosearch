The city of Wuhan is afflicted by one of the deadliest viruses ever known to mankind. There are NN centres in the city and every centre has A[i]A[i] people afflicted with the virus. The government has a total of MM masks that needs to be given to the people afflicted by the virus. The government has appointed you to inform them whether these M marks will be enough for the afflicted people or they need to buy more.
So print 1 if the M masks will be enough or 0 if they need to buy more.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers N and M  denoting the number of centres in Wuhan and the number of masks.
The second line contains N space-separated integers denoting the number of people afflicted by the virus in a particular centre.

Output:
For each testcase, print either 1 or 0.
Constraints

1≤T≤5
0≤N≤100
0≤M≤5000
0≤array[i]≤1000

Subtasks

100 points : 1≤N≤100

Sample Input:
2
5 100
10 20 20 30 5
1 20
50

Sample Output:
1
0

EXPLANATION:
For the first test case, the total number of people in 5 centres is 85 whereas the total number of masks is 100. So there is sufficient number of masks
In the second test case, there are 50 people afflicted by virus whereas there are only 20 masks. So they need to buy more.
