You are given an integer N. Construct a permutation A of length N which is attractive.
A permutation is called attractive if the bitwise XOR of all absolute differences of adjacent pairs of elements is equal to 0.
Formally, a permutation A=[A1,A2,…,AN] of length N is said to be attractive if:
|A1−A2|⊕|A2−A3|⊕…⊕|AN−1−AN|=0
where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Output any attractive permutation of length N. If no attractive permutation exists, print −1 instead.
Note: A permutation of length N is an array A=[A1,A2,…,AN] such that every integer from 1 to N occurs exactly once in A. For example, [1,2,3] and [2,3,1] are permutations of length 3, but [1,2,1], [4,1,2], and [2,3,1,4] are not.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing one integer N.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line an attractive permutation of N integers, or −1 if no attractive permutation exists.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
2≤N≤105
Sum of N over all cases won't exceed 2⋅105.

Explanation
Test Case 1: |3−2|⊕|2−1|=1⊕1=0
Note that there are other correct answers — for example, [1,2,3] would also be accepted as correct.
Test Case 2: |5−2|⊕|2−3|⊕|3−6|⊕|6−4|⊕|4−1|=3⊕1⊕3⊕2⊕3=0
