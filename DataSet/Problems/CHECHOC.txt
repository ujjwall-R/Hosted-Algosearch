You are given a matrix AA with NN rows (numbered 11 through N) and M columns (numbered 1 through M).
You need to fill the matrix with candies in such a way that:

For each cell, the number of candies in this cell is an integer between 0 and X inclusive.
For each pair of adjacent cells, the number of candies in one cell plus the number of candies in the other cell does not exceed Y. Two cells are considered adjacent if they share a side.

Find the maximum number of candies you can place in the given matrix.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers N, M, X and Y.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum number of candies.
