You are given two strings SS and RR. Each of these strings has length NN. We want to make S equal to R by performing the following operation some number of times (possibly zero):

Choose two integers a and b such that 1≤a≤b≤N.
For each i such that a≤i≤b, replace the i-th character of S by the i-th character of R.

Suppose that we make S equal to R by performing this operation k times, in such a way that the total number of replaced characters (i.e. the sum of all k values of b−a+1) is l. Then, the cost of this process is defined as k⋅l.
Find the minimum cost with which we can make S equal to R.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single string S.
The second line contains a single string R.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum cost.
Constraints

1≤T≤4,000
1≤N≤106
|S|=|R|=N
S and R contain only lowercase English letters
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅106

Explanation
Example case 1: S can be made equal to R in two moves. First, we replace S1 by R1 and then replace S5 by R5. We have k=l=2, so the cost is 2⋅2=4. If we wanted to perform only one operation, the cost would be 5.
