You are given a connected graph with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN) and N−1 bidirectional edges. Also, you are given a sequence K1,K2,…,KN.
Let's denote the distance between vertices u and v by d(u,v). Next, for each valid i, let's define Di as the maximum integer such that there are at least Ki vertices v with d(i,v)>Di. (It can be proven that such integers exist for the given constraints.)
Your task is to find the values of D1,D2,…,DN.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers K1,K2,…,KN.
Each of the next N−1 lines contains two space-separated integeres u and v denoting that vertices u and v are connected by an edge.

Output
Print a single line containing N space-separated integers D1,D2,…,DN.
Constraints

1≤N≤105
1≤Ki≤N−1 for each valid i
1≤u,v≤N
