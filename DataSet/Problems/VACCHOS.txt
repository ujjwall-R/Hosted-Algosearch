Note:-> If Patients of a Hospital is less than K then it is said to be Normal.

Input:
1)The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers denoting N and D respectively.
2)The second line contains N space separated integers denoting Patients P1,P2,….PN.

Output:
1)Print only one line containing a single integer denoting the smallest K as explained in the problem statement.
2)If it is not possible to find such K, then print −1

Constraints:
1≤N≤10^5
1≤Pi≤10^4 
1≤D≤10^9

Sample Input:
6 16
2 3 4 5 7 16

Sample Output:
3

Explanation:
By Vaccinating 3 Patients for up to 16 Days He can Vaccinate all the Patients.
