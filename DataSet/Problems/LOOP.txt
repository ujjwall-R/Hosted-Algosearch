There is a circular track of length MM consisting of MM checkpoints and MM bidirectional roads such that each road has a length of 1 unit.

Chef is currently at checkpoint A and wants to reach checkpoint B. Find the minimum length of the road he needs to travel.
Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of input, three integers A,B, and M - the initial checkpoint, the final checkpoint, and the total number of checkpoints respectively.

Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum length Chef needs to travel.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
2≤M≤109
1≤A,B≤M
A≠B

Explanation
Test Case 1: Chef can go from 1 to 3 as: 1→2 and then 2→3. Thus, total length travelled is 2 units.
Test Case 2: Chef can go from 1 to 98 as: 98←99←100←1. Thus, minimum distance travelled is 3 units.
Test Case 3: Chef can go from 40 to 30 as: 30←31←32←⋯←39←40. Thus, minimum distance travelled is 10 units.
Test Case 4: Chef can go from 2 to 1 as: 1←2. Thus, minimum distance travelled is 1 unit.
