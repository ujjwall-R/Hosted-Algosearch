Explanation
Test Case 1: The capacity of the bucket is 5 liters but it is already filled with 4 liters of water. Adding 1 more liter of water to the bucket fills it to (4+1)=5 liters. If we try to fill more water, it will overflow.
Test Case 2: The capacity of the bucket is 15 liters but it is already filled with 6 liters of water. Adding 9 more liters of water to the bucket fills it to (6+9)=15 liters. If we try to fill more water, it will overflow.
