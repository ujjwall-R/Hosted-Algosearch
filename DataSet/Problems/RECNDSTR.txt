Chef has a string S consisting of lowercase English characters. Chef defined functions left shift L(X) and right shift R(X) as follows.

L(X) is defined as shifting all characters of string X  one step towards left and moving the first character to the end.
R(X) is defined as shifting all characters of string X one step towards the right and moving the last character to the beginning.

For example, L("abcd") = "bcda" and R("abcd") = "dabc"
Chef wants to find out whether there exists a string V of the same length as S such that both L(V)=S and R(V)=S holds.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a string S.

Output:
For each test case, If there exists a valid string V, print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (without the quotes).
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤|S|≤106
S contains all lower case English alphabets.
It's guaranteed that the total length of the strings in one test file doesn't exceed 106


                        Sample Input 1
                        





4
a
ab
abcd
aaaaa



                        Sample Output 1
                        





YES
YES
NO
YES


Explanation

In the first test case, Chef can choose V=S
In the second test case, Chef can choose V = "ba" which satisfies both conditions.
There doesn't exist any valid choice for string V in the third test case.
