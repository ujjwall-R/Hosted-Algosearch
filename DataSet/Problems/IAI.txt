You are given a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and MM intervals [L1,R1],[L2,R2],…,[LM,RM][L1,R1],[L2,R2],…,[LM,RM]. For any subset SS of these intervals:

If SS is non-empty, let's define L=maxi∈S(Li)L=maxi∈S(Li) and R=mini∈S(Ri)R=mini∈S(Ri).
The set SS is disjoint if SS is empty or L>RL>R. Otherwise, the intersection of the intervals from this set is the interval [L,R][L,R].
If SS is not disjoint, its value is ∑Rj=L(j−L+1)⋅Aj∑Rj=L(j−L+1)⋅Aj.

Find the maximum of values of all non-disjoint subsets of the given intervals.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
M lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤M), the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Li and Ri.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum value of a non-disjoint subset.

Explanation
Example case 1: It is optimal to choose the intervals [1,2] and [2,3]. Their intersection is the interval [2,2] (so the set of these two intervals is not disjoint) and its value is A2⋅1=1.
