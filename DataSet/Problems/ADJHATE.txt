An array is called lovely if the sum of absolute differences of each adjacent pair of elements is odd; formally, the array SS of size mm is lovely if ∑m−1i=1∑m−1i=1 |Si−Si+1||Si−Si+1| is odd.
You are given an array A of N integers. You need to reorder the array in any manner such that the array becomes lovely. If there is no reordering operation that makes the array lovely, output -1.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing N integers denoting the modified array which is lovely, or -1 if it is not possible.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
2≤N≤500
1≤Ai≤106

1 2 3 10 7 12
-1


Explanation

For the first test case, the sum is |1−2|+|2−3|+|3−10|+|10−7|+|7−12|=1+1+7+3+5=17 which is odd.
For the second test case, |1−3|=2 which is even. There is no array that can satisfy the above condition.
