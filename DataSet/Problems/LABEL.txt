Chef likes to play with trees a lot, so his best friend Smurf has given him a tree T consisting of N nodes numbered from 1 to N. 
Smurf asked him to count the number of ways to assign an integer in the range [1, M] to each of the nodes of the tree such that the absolute difference between the integers assigned to any pair of adjacent nodes is greater or equal than K (i. e ≥ K). Since this number can be huge, Chef only needs to find it modulo 109 + 7 (1000000007)
Of course this task is tough for our little chef and he cannot solve it without your help. Can you help him?
Input
The first line of input contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases. 
The first line of each test case contains three space separated integers denoting N, M and K, denoting the number of nodes in the tree and the values of M and K respectively. 
The following (N-1) lines of each test case contain two space separated integers u and v denoting that there is an edge between the nodes u and v.
Output
For each test case, print the answer in a separate line.
