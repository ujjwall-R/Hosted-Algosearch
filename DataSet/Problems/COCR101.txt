In the Parallel World of Competitive Programming, formally known as PWCP, every coder has a   unique positive integer Rating i.e. Rating > 0.
There are two types of coders :
Type 1 : One who code in groups during a contest.
Type 2 : One who code alone during a contest.                
Iron Man being a genius tries to find out all the coders who code in groups during contests. Let us consider a list of N integers where ith integer denotes rating of ith coder of type 1 as [A1,A2,A3,....AN].
If a coder has rating X, he belongs to type 1 if and only if there exists atleast one element in A for which GCD(X,Ai)=Ai holds true . ( Because it shows that this coder helped the ith coder in some problem. )
Coders who do not belong to type 1, belong to type 2.
Your task is to find Kth highest Rated Coder of type 1 and type 2. As it is a very simple task, Iron Man gave you another task. 
Consider the function given below :            
int F(int x, int y) {     if (y == 0)         return x;     else        return F( x ^ y, (x & y) << 1); } 
Let ,
X1=Kth highest Rated Coder of Type 1 and X2=Kth highest Rated Coder of Type 2 , Also  L=min(X1,X2) , R=max(X1,X2) 
Let us define G(L,R) as ,
G(L,R)=F(L,F(L+1,F(L+2,F(L+3,F(L+4,.......F(R−1,R)))))) 
You have to report G(L,R) as well. Since this number can be huge compute it modulo 109+7. 
Also if there does not exist any Kth highest rated coder of type 1 or type 2 then you have to print  −1.            
Input:

First line contains T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains two lines
First line contains two integers N,K. 
Second line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,A3,.....AN

Output:
For each testcase,
if there doesn't exist any Kth highest rated coder of type 1 or type 2 : print −1.
Else print Two lines .
First Line containing two space separated integers  :- Kth highest rated coder of type 1 and Kth highest rated coder of type 2.
Second line contains a single integer : G(L,R)
Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤N≤105
1≤K≤1016 
1≤Ai≤109 
Product  of all elements of array in a single testcase A does not exceed 1018.
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106 
Kth highest rated coder of both type 1 and type 2 doesnot exceeds 1018 if it exist. 

Sample Input:
1
2 5         
2 3          

Sample Output:
8 13          
63        

EXPLANATION:
Type 1 coders :  [2,3,4,6,8,9,...]
As K=5 X1 = 8
Type 2 coders :  [1,5,7,11,13,...]
As K=5 X2 = 13
L = 8 , R = 13
G(8,13)=F(8,F(9,F(10,F(11,F(12,13)))))=63
