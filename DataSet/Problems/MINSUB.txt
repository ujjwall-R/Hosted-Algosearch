You are given a binary string AA of length NN. Rearrange the binary string to form binary strings S and T such that the length of the longest common substring between S and T is minimum.
Print both strings S and T.
Note that both S and T must be anagrams of A — see the examples below for more clarity.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of two lines.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N — the length of the binary string A.
The second line of each test case contains a binary string A of length N.

Output Format

For each test case, output two lines. The first line contains string S while the second line contains string T. Both strings S and T must be anagrams of string A and thus, have length N.

Constraints

1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤1000
Sum of N over all cases does not exceed 3000.

Explanation
Test case 1: The given string is A=101. Two rearrangements of A such that the length of longest common substring is minimum are S=110 and T=011. The longest common substring between strings S and T is 11, having length 2. It can be proved that for no other pair of rearrangements of string A, the LCS has a length less than 2.
Test case 2: The given string is A=1111. Here, all rearrangements of A are the same. Two rearrangements of A such that the length of longest common substring is minimum are S=1111 and T=1111. The longest common substring between strings S and T is 1111, having length 4.
Test case 3: The given string is A=0111. Two rearrangements of A such that the length of longest common substring is minimum are S=1101 and T=0111. The longest common substring between strings S and T is 01 having length 2. It can be proved that for no other pair of rearrangements of string A, the LCS has a length less than 2.
