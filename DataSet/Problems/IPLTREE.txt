Russell for his next IPL match invited his relatives. Now Russell is interested to play a game with his Nephew taking a problem of tree resembling IPL match hierarchy . So he describes the problem like,
In the tree with  N leaves and N−1 edges , where the leaves denoting match points gained previously varies from 0 to any natural number of some particular i-th team and there are N-1 pairs of leaves {ai , bi} between which there is an edge. Edge I connects leaves ai and bi . Each team in the tree has a previous point written on its leaf . Let ci be the value written on leaf i (basically team i) . Nephew will be given Q queries . The i-th query, consisting of integers qi, ei, and xi, is as follows :  

If qi=1: for each leaf v reachable from leaf aei without visiting leaf bei by traversing edges, replace cv with cv+xi.  
If qi=2: for each leaf v reachable from leaf bei without visiting leaf aei by traversing edges , replace cv with cv+xi.
After processing all queries , print total new points of each team written on each leaf . 

Constraints:

All values in input are integers.  
2 ≤ N ≤ 2×10^5  
1 ≤ ai,bi ≤ N  
1 ≤ Q ≤ 2×10^5  
ti ∈ {1,2}  
1 ≤ ei ≤ N−1  
1 ≤ xi ≤ 10^9  
0 ≤ ci ≤ 10^9  

Input Format:
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
