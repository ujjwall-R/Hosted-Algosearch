You are given two integers A,BA,B. You have to choose an integer XX in the range [minimum(A,BA,B), maximum(A,BA,B)] such that: 
⌈B−X2⌉+⌈X−A2⌉ is maximum. 
What is the maximum sum you can obtain if you choose X optimally?
Note: ⌈x⌉ : Returns the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to x (i.e  rounds up to the nearest integer). For example, ⌈1.4⌉=2, ⌈5⌉=5, ⌈−1.5⌉=−1, ⌈−3⌉=−3 , ⌈0⌉=0.
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers A,B.

Output Format
For each testcase, output the maximum sum of ⌈B−X2⌉+⌈X−A2⌉.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤A,B≤109

Explanation

In the first test case, there is only one possible value of X which is equal to 2. So the sum is equal to ⌈2−22⌉+⌈2−22⌉ = ⌈ 0⌉+⌈ 0⌉  = 0+0=0.
In the second test case, we can choose X to be 2. So sum is equal to ⌈11−22⌉+⌈2−12⌉ = ⌈ 4.5⌉+⌈ 0.5⌉ = 5+1=6. There is no possible way to choose an integer X in the range [1,11] such that sum is greater than 6.
