The question is as follows: 


Given a number N, which is the size of array where indices are from 1 to N .
Initially all the elements of array are 0 . 
Q queries are given . 
Each query contains two variables L and R . 
For each query you have to perform the following operation : for each index i where L<=i<=R  you have to add a value of of (i-L+1) to the array element at index i .
After performing Q queries, a number M is given. It is followed by M number of indices (I) where, for each index you have to output the value of element present in that index (I) of array.


Input

First line contains an integer N indicating the size of array indexed from 1 to N.
Second line contains an integer Q denoting the number of Queries.
It is followed by Q number of lines where each line contains two space seperated integers L and R. 
Next Line contains an Integer M denoting number of queries whose output is to be printed.
It is followed by M number of lines where each line contains an integer I (index of element in array).
Output
For each of the M queries, output the value of element present in the  array at index I.
Constraints

1 <= N <= 1000000
1 <= Q <= 1000000
1 <= L <= R <= N
1 <= M <= N
