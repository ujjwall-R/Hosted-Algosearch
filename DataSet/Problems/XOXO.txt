You are given three integers NN, KK and X. Is it possible to find a sequence of non-negative integers A1,A2,…,AN such that the number of pairs of indices (i,j) (1≤i≤j≤N) satisfying Ai⊕Aj=X is equal to K? Here, ⊕ is the bitwise XOR operator.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, K and X.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to find a sequence satisfying the given condition or "NO" if it is impossible (without quotes).
Constraints

1≤T≤4⋅105
1≤N,K,X≤3⋅105

5
4 3 3
5 8 1
10 8 2
19 100 34

                        Sample Output 1
                        





YES
NO
YES
NO
YES


Explanation
Example case 1: For example, A=[2,2,1,2] satisfies the given condition, since there are exactly 3 pairs (i,j) such that Ai⊕Aj=3.
Example case 3: For example, A=[8,12,3,14,8,15,10,10,8,14] satisfies the given condition, since there are exactly 8 pairs with XOR equal to 2.
