Chef calls a sequence of integers A1,A2,…,AN good if it satisfies the following conditions:

Ai⊕Ai+1>0 for all valid i
Ai−1⊕Ai⊕Ai+1=Ai for all valid i

In particular, any sequence with length 1 is good and any sequence of length 2 which satisfies the first condition is good.
Here, ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Chef gives you a sequence A1,A2,…,AN. You may perform the following operation on the sequence any number of times (possibly 0): choose 3 pairwise distinct valid indices a, b and c and change Ac to Aa⊕Ab. Note that this means the operation can only be performed if N≥3.
Chef is asking you to make the sequence good using at most 3⋅N operations or report that it is impossible. Note that you do not have to minimise the number of performed operations.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case:

If it is impossible to change the given sequence into a good sequence using at most 3⋅N operations, print a single line containing the integer −1.
Otherwise, first, print a line containing a single integer M (0≤M≤3⋅N) ― the number of operations you want to perform.
Then, print M lines describing these operations in the order in which you want to perform them. For each i (1≤i≤M), the i-th of these lines should contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (pairwise distinct; 1≤ai,bi,ci≤N) ― the indices on which the i-th operation is performed.

If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them.
Constraints

1≤T≤103
1≤N≤104
0≤Ai<230 for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅104

Example Input
4
1
69
3
1 2 3
3
1 3 1
2
10 10

Example Output
0
-1
4
1 3 2
2 1 3
3 2 1
1 3 2
-1

Explanation
Example case 1: The sequence is already good, so performing 0 operations is a valid solution.
Example case 2: The sequence cannot be made good using at most 3⋅N operations.
Example case 3: We can make the sequence good by performing the 4 operations shown on the output, in this order. Note that the initial sequence is also good, so performing 0 operations is also a valid solution. 
Example case 4: The sequence does not satisfy the first condition and since N=2, we cannot perform any operations on it.
