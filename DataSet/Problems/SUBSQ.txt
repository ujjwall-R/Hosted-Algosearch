Given a sequence A of length N and an integer M, such that the elements of A are pairwise distinct.
For each k (1≤k≤M), find the number of subsequences Ai1,Ai2,…,Aip of A satisfying the following conditions:

Condition 1: ∑pj=1Aij=k.
Condition 2: Let f(l,r)=maxri=lAi. Then, for each j (1≤j≤p−1), f(ij,ij+1)>max(Aij,Aij+1) holds.
If p=1 (subsequence is of length 1), this condition is considered to be true.

Find the number of subsequences satisfying both the conditions for each k (1≤k≤M). Since the answer can be huge, print it modulo 998244353.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line contains two integers N and M.
The second line contains N integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each test case, print M numbers in a new line. The ith number is the answer when k=i, modulo 998244353.

Explanation
Test Case 1: 

k=1: The only subsequence satisfying both the conditions is {1}.  

The sum of all elements of this subsequence is 1.  
Since there is only one element in the subsequence, we consider the second condition to be true.
k=2: The only subsequence satisfying both the conditions is \{2\}.  

The sum of all elements of this subsequence is 2.  
Since there is only one element in the subsequence, we consider the second condition to be true.
k=3: The subsequences satisfying both the conditions are \{3\} and \{2,1\}. For the subsequence \{2,1\}:

The sum of all elements of this subsequence is 2+1=3.  
There are 2 elements in the subsequence. The indices of these elements in the sequence are 1 and 5 respectively. Here, f(1,5) = \max_{i=1}^{5}A_i = 5 and \max(2, 1) = 2. Thus, f(1, 5) > \max(A_1, A_5).
k=4: The subsequences satisfying both the conditions are \{4\} and \{3,1\}. For the subsequence \{3,1\}:

The sum of all elements of this subsequence is 3+1 = 4.  
There are 2 elements in the subsequence. The indices of these elements in the sequence are 3 and 5 respectively. Here, f(3,5) = \max_{i=3}^{5}A_i = 5 and \max(3, 1) = 3. Thus, f(3, 5) > \max(A_3, A_5).
k=5: The subsequences satisfying both the conditions are \{3\}, \{4,1\} and \{2,3\}. For the subsequence \{2,3\}:

The sum of all elements of this subsequence is 2+3=5.  
There are 2 elements in the subsequence. The indices of these elements in the sequence are 1 and 3 respectively. Here, f(1,3) = \max_{i=1}^{3}A_i = 4 and \max(2, 3) = 3. Thus, f(1, 3) > \max(A_1, A_3).
k=6: The only subsequence satisfying both the conditions is \{2,3,1\}.  

The sum of all elements of this subsequence is 2+3+1=6.  
There are 3 elements in the subsequence. The indices of these elements in the sequence are 1,3 and 5 respectively. Here, f(1,3) = \max_{i=1}^{3}A_i = 4 and \max(2, 3) = 3. Thus, f(1, 3) > \max(A_1, A_3). Similarly, f(3,5) = \max_{i=3}^{5}A_i = 5 and \max(3, 1) = 3. Thus, f(3, 5) > \max(A_3, A_5).
