There are two sequences A1,A2,…,AN and B1,B2,…,BN. Answer Q queries on these sequences.
In each query, you should calculate the dot product of subsequences Ax,Ax+1,…,Ax+l−1 and By,By+1,…,By+l−1, i.e. the value of the expression
l−1∑k=0Ax+kBy+k.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
The third line contains N space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BN.
Each of the following Q lines contains three space-separated integers x, y and l describing one query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the answer to the query (the dot product).
Constraints

1≤T≤30,000
1≤N,Q≤105
1≤Ai,Bi≤104 for each valid i
the sum of N for all test cases does not exceed 105
the sum of Q for all test cases does not exceed 105
