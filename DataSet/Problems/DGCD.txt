You're given a tree on N vertices. Each vertex has a positive integer written on it, number on the ith vertex being vi. Your program must process two types of queries :


1. Find query represented by F u v   : Find out gcd of all numbers on the unique path between vertices u and v in the tree (both inclusive).
2. Change query represented by C u v d : Add d to the number written on all vertices along the unique path between vertices u and v in the tree (both inclusive). 

Input
First line of input contains an integer N denoting the size of the vertex set of the tree. Then follow N - 1 lines, ith of which contains two integers ai and bi denoting an edge between vertices ai and bi in the tree. After this follow N space separated integers in a single line denoting initial values vi at each of these nodes. Then follows a single integer Q on a line by itself, denoting the number of queries to follow. Then follow Q queries, each one on a line by itself. Each query is either a find query or a change query with format as given in problem statement. Note that all vertices are 0-based.

OutputFor every find query, print the answer to that query in one line by itself.

Example
Input:
6
0 4
0 5
1 5
5 2
3 5
3 1 3 2 4 2
5
F 3 5
C 1 3 1
C 3 4 4
F 3 0
F 2 5

Output:
2
7
1


Constraints
1 <= N <= 50000
1 <= Q <= 50000
0 <= u, v <= N-1 
1 <= vi <= 10^4 
0 <= d <= 10^4
