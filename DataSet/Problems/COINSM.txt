 
Suyash was provided with an array of length N initially filled with 0’s. Later he was given Q 
queries each with three parameters L, R & W where W is the weight that has to be added to 
each element of the array in the index range L to R (index is 1 based). He was asked to 
execute all the queries and return the final array. Since Suyash was
 busy in some other task 
he called for your help
 
Input
 
First line contains two integers N and Q. 
Next Q lines contains three integers L, R and W. 
 
Output
The final resultant output array
 The elements of the resultant array should be seperated by spaces. 
Constraints
1 ≤ N, Q, W ≤ 100000 
1 ≤ L<= R ≤ N 
 
Example
Input:

5 2 

1 3 2 

2 2 3 
Output:
2 5 2 0 0

 
Explanation
Example case 1.
Intitally the array is 0 0 0 0 0
After addition of 2 to all elements from range 1 to 3
elements are  2 2 2 0 0
After addition of 3 to all elements from range 2 to 2
elements are  2 5 2 0 0
