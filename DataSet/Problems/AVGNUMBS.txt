AK and his friends have just submitted their assignments a few seconds before the deadline and they  want to celebrate at the Juice Canteen. They decide to pool in all their cash and order some oreo shakes.
You are given an integer NN, the number of students, and a list of nn integers where ci is the amount of cash the i-th student has. Find the average amount that each student can place an order for, given that they pool all their money together.
Input
The first line contains a single integer N (1≤N≤100), the number of students
The second line contains N integers, c1,c2,…cn, where ci is the amount of cash the i-th student has. (0≤ci≤100)
Output
Output the average of the N inputs.
Let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if |a−b|max(1,b)≤10−4
Sample Input
3 
1 2 3

Sample Output
2.000000000

Explanation
The average of the three inputs is 3+2+13=2
