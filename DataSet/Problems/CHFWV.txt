One day Chef's friend gave him a sequence a1,a2,a3,a4.....an. He told Chef to find the length of the longest appearing 
Even Sequence. An even sequence is a sequence formed with only consecutive even numbers(e.g. 4 8 2 14 is an even sequence but 4 8 5 14 is not). But the twist is that firstly 
he wants Chef to convert the sequence in a specified form where b1>= b2<=b3 >=b4<=.......... upto n terms and then find the length 
of the longest appearing Even Sequence.
NOTE: If there are multiple sequence possible, take the one that's lexicographically smallest.

Input

The first line of input contains one integer N denoting the numbers of Test Cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of element in the Sequence. 
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the sequence.


Output
output a single line containing the length of the longest appearing Even Sequence.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 105


Example Input
2
5
1 2 3 4 5
6
6 7 8 10 12 16


Example Output
1
5


Explanation
Example case 1:The given sequence can be converted to 2 1 4 3 5, 5 2 3 1 4 etc.. but we'll take the lexicographically smallest one i.e. 2 1 4 3 5.  
Now we can see the longest appearing Even Sequence in the new sequence is 1.
Example case 2:Similarly as case 1 the lexicographically smallest sequence is 7 6 10 8 16 12 and the lenght of the longest appearing Even sequence is 5.
