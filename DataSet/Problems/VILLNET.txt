In the nation of Chefland there are villages at co-ordinates (x,y)(x,y) whenever xx and y are non-zero odd co-prime integers. x can be either positive or negative, but y is always positive.
In each village (x,y) there is a crossroads, with the roads marked North, South, East, West.
Road East leads to (x+2y,y).
Road West leads to (x−2y,y).
Road North leads to either (x,y+2x) or (−x,−(y+2x)),  chosen so that the new y co-ordinate is positive.
Road South leads to either (x,y−2x) or (−x,−(y−2x)), chosen so that the new y co-ordinate is positive.  
Some citizens of Chefland prefer these equivalent definitions for the North and South roads:
Road North leads to {(x,y+2x)when y+2x>0(−x,−(y+2x))when y+2x<0 
Road South leads to {(x,y−2x)when y−2x>0(−x,−(y−2x))when y−2x<0 
The cost to travel a road between two adjacent villages is 1 pound.
Determine the minimum cost to travel between villages at (x1,y1) and (x2,y2). 
Notes:

The road network is defined so that the villages form an undirected graph.
There are two roads joining (−1,1) and (1,1), but otherwise there is a single road between any adjacent pair of villages.
The road network does not form a simple grid - that would be too easy!

Input:

First line will contain T, the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains a single line of input, which has four integers x1,y1,x2,y2. 

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line, the answer. That is, the minimum cost in pounds to travel from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2).
Constraints

T≤1000 

The co-ordinates (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) of the villages satisfy

−1015<x1,x2<1015 and
0<y1,y2<1015

Subtasks

10 points : −10<x1,x2<10 and 0<y1,y2<10 
10 points : original constraints, but the villages are selected so that the minimum cost for each testcase is <6
30 points: −106<x1,x2<106 and 0<y1,y2<106
50 points: original constraints

Explanation
In the first test case, the start and end village co-ordinates are both (7,5), so the cost is 0.
In the second test case:
From (1,1) go West to (−1,1) in one step. So the cost is 1.
Note that the South road from (1,1) also goes to (−1,1).
In the third test case:
From (3,7) go South to (3,1).
From (3,1) go West to (1,1).
From (1,1) go West to (−1,1).
From (−1,1) go West to (−3,1).
From (−3,1) go West to (−5,1).
From (−5,1) go North to (5,9).
