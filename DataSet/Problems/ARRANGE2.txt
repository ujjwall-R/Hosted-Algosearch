A number X is called Permut number if X and 2X ( both without leading zeroes ) have same number of digits and are permutations of each other. Given A and B, find the number of Permut numbers >= A and <= B.


Note : X is called permutation of Y if every digit ( 0 - 9 ) occurs same number of times in both the numbers ( maybe at different positions ).


Input :


The first line contains the number of test cases T. T lines follow, containing two integers A and B.


Output :


Output T lines, one for each test case containing the desired answer for the corresponding test case.

Constraints :
1 <= T <= 10000
1 <= A <= B <= 10000000000 (10^10)
