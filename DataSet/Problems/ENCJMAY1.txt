Alice and Bob are stuck in the quarantine and are bored. So they play a game in which Alice pretends to have a square sheet of paper and he tore it into two rectangles. Now Bob has to predict whether the initial sheet of paper was a square or not.
Input:

First-line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
Each test case contains 2 lines of input, integers L1,B1.(dimension of one sheet) 
and  L2,B2.(dimension of the other sheet)

Output:
For each Testcase print in a single line "YES" (withoutquotes) if the original sheet was a square or else "NO" (withoutquotes).
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
2≤L,B≤109

Sample Input:
3
3 2
3 1
2 1
2 2
3 1
3 1

Sample Output:
YES
NO
NO

EXPLANATION:
In case 1:

L1=3; B1=2 and L2=3; B2=1
Here, if we join the two sheets we might get a rectangle with dimension 3X3 which is a square
In case 2:
L1=2; B1=1 and L2=2; B2=2
Here, if we join the two sheets we might get a rectangle with dimension 2X3 which is not a square

In case 3:
L1=3; B1=1 and L2=3; B2=1
Here, if we join the two sheets we might get a rectangle with dimension 6X1 or 3X2  and neither of them is a square is not a square
