One of the faculty who comes to their classroom wants to know about the students who study extremely well as the faculty decides to give extra training to those students and improve them further for good placements. The faculty decides to select the students on the basis of their previous semester marks. He wants only the top rankers of the entire class in the previous semester i.e., notice that there can be more than one student for a particular rank if they score the same marks.
So the faculty wants to find out all the roll numbers of the first 'k' ranks(Here k represents the number of ranks that faculty wants to find out). Help the faculty in finding out all the roll numbers of rankers of the class.(The indices of the array are considered as the rollnumbers of the students, consider array indices from 1).

            
                
                    Input Format
