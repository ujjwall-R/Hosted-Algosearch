Chef lives in a country called ChefLand. The country can be represented as a tree of NN cities (numbered 11 through NN) connected by N−1 roads. For each valid i, the cost of a house in city i is Ai.
You should answer Q queries. In each query, you are given cities u and v (possibly identical); Chef is planning to buy houses in these cities. Chef's happiness quotient is equal to the product of the costs of houses in all cities which lie on the simple path between u and v (both inclusive). Since Chef loves playing with factors, he is asking you to tell him the number of factors of his happiness quotient, modulo 1,000,000,007 (109+7).
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
Each of the next N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers x and y denoting that cities x and y are connected by a road.
The following line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
The following line contains a single integer Q.
Each of the next Q lines contains two space-separated integers u and v describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of factors of the happiness quotient modulo 1,000,000,007 (109+7).
