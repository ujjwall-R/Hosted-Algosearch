Leonardo is the best friend of the chef and a good mathematician also. When the chef is stuck in any problem he asks for help from his friend Leonardo.                    
Unfortunately, the chef is stuck in a problem and asks from his mathematician friend to calculate the sum from position L to R (Inclusive) of the special Fibonacci sequence.
Special fibbonacci sequence (sf) is defined as 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,3…... i.e. the ith term of the series is the ith term of fibonacci sequence modulo 10.
Formarly, Leonardo has to calculate  v= ∑i=LR sfi
If the given range is invalid, print −1
CONSTRAINTS.
1<=T<=10^4
0<=L<=10^7
0<=R<=10^7
INPUT
First contains number of testcases T .
Each testcases contains single line two space separated integer L and R.
OUTPUT
Print a singe line value of v if possible else print -1.
SAMPLE INPUT
3
1 4
0 5
3 3
SAMPLE OUTPUT
7
12
2
EXPLANATION
f1%10 =1+ f2 %10=1+ f3%10 =2 + f4%10=3 is  7
f0%10= 0+f1%10=1+ f2%10 =1+f3 %10=2+f4%10=3+f5%10=5 is 12
f3%10=2 is 2
Sum is possible if  R-L is Non-negative.
