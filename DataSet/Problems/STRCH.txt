Shlok and Sachin are good friends. Shlok wanted to test Sachin, so he wrote down a string SS with length NN and one character XX. He wants Sachin to find the number of different substrings of S which contain the character X at least once. Sachin is busy with his girlfriend, so he needs you to find the answer.
Two substrings of S are considered different if their positions in S are different.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N. 
The second line contains a string S with length N, followed by a space and a character X.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of substrings of S that contain X.
Constraints

1≤T≤1,000
1≤N≤106
S contains only lowercase English letters
X is a lowercase English letter
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (30 points): the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 103
Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints
