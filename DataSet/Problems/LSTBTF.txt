Let's call a positive integer MM a beautiful number if the following conditions are satisfied:

The decimal representation of MM (without leading zeros) does not contain any zeros.
The sum of squares of all decimal digits of MM is a perfect square.

For example, 1, 4 and 221 are beautiful, but 10 and 333 are not.
You are given a positive integer N. Find the smallest N-digit beautiful number or determine that all N-digit integers are not beautiful.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest N-digit beautiful number, or −1 if there is no such number.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤N≤106
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (10 points): 1≤N≤100
Subtask #2 (90 points): 1≤T≤10

1
34


Explanation
Example case 1: It is obvious that 1 is the smallest beautiful number.
Example case 2: 34 is beautiful because 32+42=9+16=25=52. On the other hand, we can prove that this is the smallest beautiful number.
