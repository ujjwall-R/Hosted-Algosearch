You are given with a string SS. The string contains N number of valid fragments. The fragment is a substring of a string. The fragment is called valid, if the string starts with the word "newyear", then goes on with 0 or more characters in-between, and eventually ends with the string "2021". Find such N valid fragments.
The two fragments are considered to be different, if they start or end at different positions in the string S, even if the fragments read the same. Note that different valid fragments may overlap.

Input:

The first line and only line contains a string S. Containing only lowercase letters and numbers as characters.


Output:

Print a single line containing the integer N – the number of valid fragments.
