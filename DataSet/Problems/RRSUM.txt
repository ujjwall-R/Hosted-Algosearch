Andrii is good in Math, but not in Programming. He is asking you to solve following problem: Given an integer number N and two sets of integer A and B. Let set A contain all numbers from 1 to N and set B contain all numbers from N + 1 to 2N. Multiset C contains all sums a + b such that a belongs to A and b belongs to B. Note that multiset may contain several elements with the same values. For example, if N equals to three, then A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {4, 5, 6} and C = {5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9}. Andrii has M queries about multiset C. Every query is defined by a single integer q. Andrii wants to know the number of times q is contained in C. For example, number 6 is contained two times, 1 is not contained in C at all. 
Please, help Andrii to answer all the queries.
 
Input

The first line of the input contains two integers N and M. Each of the next M line contains one integer q, the query asked by Andrii.
 
Output
Output the answer for each query in separate lines as in example.
 
Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 109
1 ≤ M ≤ 105
1 ≤ q ≤ 3N
