Consider an undirected graph G with N vertices, numbered 1 through N. You are given an integer sequence A1,A2,…,AN describing the edges of this graph — for each pair of vertices u and v, there is an edge between those vertices if and only if Au and Av are coprime. Find the number of connected components of G. 
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the number of connected components.
