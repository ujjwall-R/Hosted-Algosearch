There are nn chocolates, and you are given an array of nn numbers where the ii-th number Ai is the flavour type of the i-th chocolate. Sebrina wants to eat as many different types of chocolates as possible, but she also has to save at least x number of chocolates for her little brother. 
Find the maximum possible number of distinct flavour types Sebrina can have.
Input:
The first line contains an integer T --- the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case consists of two integers n, x - The number of chocolates Sabrina has and the number of chocolates she has to save for her brother, respectively.
The second line contains n integers A1,…,An, where the i-th chocolate has type Ai.
Output:
For each test case, output a single integer denoting the maximum possible number of distinct chocolate flavours Sabrina can eat.
Constraints
1≤T≤10
1≤x≤n≤2⋅105 
1≤Ai≤109
Sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 2⋅105

Explanation
Test case 1: In the first case, the maximum number of chocolates Sebrina can have is 1 as she has to leave 1 chocolate for her brother. Thus, the maximum number of distinct chocolates is also 1.
Test case 2: Sebrina has to leave 2 chocolates for her brother. She can eat any 2 chocolates. Since all the chocolates have the same flavor, it does not matter which chocolates she eats. The maximum number of distinct chocolates would be 1.
Test case 3: Sebrina needs to save 3 chocolates for her brother. She can eat any 2 chocolates. To maximize the number of distinct chocolates, she can eat chocolates 1 and 5 with flavors 50 and 100 respectively. Thus maximum number of distinct chocolates is 2.
