There are N students numbered 1,2,…,N. Their teacher wants to group them. The teacher is a fan of randomness and uses the following :
Let g denote the current number of groups. First the teacher makes one group containing the student 1. So, initially g=1. Now, for each student i from 2 to N in this order:

With probability 1/(g+1), he creates a new group containing only student i. So, now g is increased by 1.
With probability g/(g+1), he picks one of the g groups at random and adds student i to that group.

Find the expected value of sum of squares of the group sizes. If the answer is P/Q with gcd(P,Q)=1, print the value of PQ−1 modulo 998244353. Here Q−1 denotes the modular inverse of Q modulo 998244353.
Input:

The only line of the input contains a single integer, N.

Output:
Find the expected value of sum of squares of the group sizes modulo 998244353.

Explanation:
In the first example:

With probability 1/2, there are two groups,  {1} and {2}. Sum of squares of sizes is 2.
With probability 1/2, there is a single group  {1,2}. Sum of squares of sizes is 4.

So, the required expected value is 1/2×2+1/2×4=3.
In the second example,

With probability 1/6, there are three groups : {1}, {2} and {3}. The sum of squares of sizes here is 3.
With probability 1/6, there are two groups : {1,3} and {2}. The sum of squares of sizes here is 5.
With probability 1/6, there are two groups : {1} and {2,3}. The sum of squares of sizes here is 5.
With probability 1/4, there are two groups : {1,2} and {3}. The sum of squares of sizes here is 5.
With probability 1/4, there is only one group : {1,2,3}. The sum of squares of sizes is 9.

The expected value, therefore is 1/6×(3+5+5)+1/4×(5+9)=173.
3−1=332748118 modulo 998244353. So, we print 17×332748118 modulo 998244353=665496241
