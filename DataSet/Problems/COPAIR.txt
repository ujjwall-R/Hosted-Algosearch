You are given two sequences A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and C1,C2,…,CNC1,C2,…,CN. For each valid ii, Ci is the colour of Ai.
You should answer Q queries. In each query:

You are given two colours x and y.
Consider the subsequence of A which contains only elements Ai such that Ci=x or Ci=y (in the original order). Let's denote it by B.
For each contiguous subsequence of B (including empty subsequence), consider the sum of all its elements. Find the maximum of these sums. 

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
The third line contains N space-separated integers C1,C2,…,CN.
Q lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers x and y describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence of B.
