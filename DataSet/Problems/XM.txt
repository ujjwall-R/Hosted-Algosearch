Vivek loves to play with sequences and XORs, so he challenges you to solve the following problem.
You are given a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. You should answer QQ queries. In each query, you are given a subsequence AL,AL+1,…,AR; the answer to this query is ∑Ri=LAi⊕(i−L), where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operator.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
The next Q lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers L and R.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer ― the answer to the query.
