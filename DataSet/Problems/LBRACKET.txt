Luther likes solving mathematical expressions. However, he hates dealing with parenthesis in his expressions. Hence, when he comes accross a problem involving bracket sequence, he asks for your help:

Given a string containing only '(' and ')', you have to handle 2 types of operations on it:

1. update x,y: flip all parenthesis in the string lying between x to y (both inclusive) (all occurrences of '(' are replaced with ')' and all occurences of ')' are replaced with '(' ).

2. query x: find the longest contiguous correct bracket sequence starting from position x.

The length of the string is N , and you have to handle Q operations.

Help Luther in performing the operations efficiently.
Note:
A Correct Bracket Sequence (CBS) is a sequence that can be obtained through following rules:
1) An empty string is a CBS. 
2) If A is a CBS, then B = (A) is also a CBS. 
3) If A and B are CBS, then C = AB is also a CBS.


Input


The first line contains 2 space seperated integers: N and Q.
The next line contains a string of length N, consisting of only '(' and ')'.
Q lines follow, each line containing the description of an operation in the following format:

for Update operation:
1 x y

for Query operation:
2 x

Output

Output the answer for each query operation on a seperate line.

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 200000
1 ≤ Q ≤ 200000
1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ N

Example
Input:
7 5
(()()))
2 1
2 2
1 4 6
2 2
2 5

Output:
6
4
2
0

Explanation:

Initially, string is: (()())) 

1. The longest CBS starting at position 1 is (()())
2. The longest CBS starting at position 2 is ()()
3. After the update, the string becomes: (())(()
4. The longest CBS starting at position 2 is ()
5. The longest CBS starting at position 5 is the empty string.
