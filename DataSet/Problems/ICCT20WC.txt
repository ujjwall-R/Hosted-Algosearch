There are NN people (Numbered 11 through NN), initially person i  is standing at position i  to buy the match ticket. If they have a ticket counter in front of them, then it is denoted as 1 or 0 otherwise. 

The ticket cost is K. All are in hurry to buy the ticket so they want to move to the ticket counter which is nearest to their position and the cost to move from position i to j is |i−j| and the total cost for the person i is |i−j|+K. 

Find the total sum of all the costs for N people.

            
                
                    Input Format

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains two lines of input, the first line contains two integers N,K. The second line contains the string S of length N which contains only two characters 1 or 0 and there is at least one 1 in the string S.

Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line answer, the total sum of all the costs for N people.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤N≤5×105
0≤K≤105

Explanation
                    In the first testcase, for person 1 the total cost is |1 - 1| + 10 = 10 and for person 2 the total cost is |2 - 1| + 10 = 11 and the total sum is 10 + 11 = 21.
In the second testcase, for person 1 the total cost is |1 - 3| + 0 = 2 and for person 2 the total cost is |2 - 3| + 0 = 1 and for person 3 the total cost is |3 - 3| - 0 = 0 and the total sum is 2 + 1 + 0 = 3.
