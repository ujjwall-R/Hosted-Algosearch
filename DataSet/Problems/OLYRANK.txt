In Olympics, the countries are ranked by the total number of medals won. You are given six integers G1G1, S1S1, B1B1, and G2G2, S2S2, B2B2, the number of gold, silver and bronze medals won by two different countries respectively. Determine which country is ranked better on the leaderboard.  It is guaranteed that there will not be a tie between the two countries.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains six space-separated integers G1G1, S1S1, B1B1, and G2G2, S2S2, B2B2.

Output Format
For each test case, print "1" if the first country is ranked better or "2" otherwise. Output the answer without quotes.

Explanation
Test case 1: Total medals for the first country are 10+20+30=60 and that for the second country are 0+29+30=59. So the first country is ranked better than the second country.
Test case 2: Total medals for the first country are 0+0+0=0 and that for the second country are 0+0+1=1. So the second country is ranked better than the first country.
