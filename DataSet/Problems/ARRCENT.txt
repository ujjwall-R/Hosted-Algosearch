In a state, there are NN cities arranged in a straight line and enumerated from 11 to NN, the ith city having a population of Ai. Atsi, being the president of the state, has to decide on which city should be the capital but to do that he wants to know what is the cost of making a particular city a capital.
The cost of making any city a capital is the sum of contribution of each person in the state. If the ith city is made the capital, then a person in the jth city would have contribution ∑dk=2(k2) where d=|i−j|+1 and i≠j. People in the capital city itself don't contribute any cost.
Atsi has hired you for helping him out with this. You have to tell him the cost of making each city the capital so that he can make a wise choice.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
The first line of each test case will contain a single integer N, the number of cities in the state.
The second line of each test case will contain N space separated integers, the population of each of the cities in order.

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line with N space separated integers, where the ith integer is the cost of making the ith city the capital taken modulo 109+7.
Constraints

2 6 4 2 3

Sample Output:
35 16 10 16 35
102 44 28 51 118

Explanation
In the first case, lets make the 3rd(middle) city the capital and see whats the cost. Each city has one person and each contribute some cost. People in 1st and 5th cities contribute (22)+(32)=1+2=4 and 2nd and 4th cities contribute (22)=1. Overcall cost of making the 3rd city becomes 4+1+1+4=10.
