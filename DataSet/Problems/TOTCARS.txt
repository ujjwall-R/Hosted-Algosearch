There are total NN cars in a sequence with ithith car being assigned with an alphabet equivalent to the ithith alphabet of string S . Chef has been assigned a task to calculate the total number of cars with alphabet having a unique even value in the given range X to Y (both inclusive)
. The value of an alphabet is simply its position in alphabetical order e.g.: a=1, b=2, c=3…
The chef will be given Q
such tasks having varying values of X and Y
Note: string S contains only lowercase alphabets
Input
First line of input contains a string S of length N.
Second line contains an integer denoting no. of queries Q.
Next q lines contain two integers denoting values of X and Y.
Output
For each query print a single integer denoting total number of cars with alphabet having a unique even value in the given range X to Y.
Constraints

1≤n≤105
1≤q≤105

Example Input
