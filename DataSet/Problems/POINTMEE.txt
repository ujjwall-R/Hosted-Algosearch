You are given NN distinct points in a 22-D plane, numbered 11 through N. The X-coordinate of the points are X1,X2,…,XN respectively and the Y-coordinates are Y1,Y2,…,YN respectively. Your goal is to make the location of all the N points equal to that of each other. To achieve this, you can do some operations.
In one operation, you choose an index i(1≤i≤N) and a real number K and change the location of the ith point in one of the following ways:

Set (Xi,Yi)=(Xi+K,Yi)
Set (Xi,Yi)=(Xi,Yi+K)
Set (Xi,Yi)=(Xi+K,Yi+K)
Set (Xi,Yi)=(Xi+K,Yi−K)

Find the minimum number of operations to achieve the goal.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case contains three lines of input.
The first line contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers X1,X2,…,XN.
The third line contains N space-separated integers Y1,Y2,…,YN.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the minimum number of operations to achieve the goal.
Constraints

1≤T≤300
2≤N≤100
−109≤Xi,Yi≤109
(Xi,Yi)≠(Xj,Yj) if (i≠j)
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 600.

Explanation
Test case 1 :  

In the first operation, you choose i=2, and K=−1 and apply the third type of operation. So the location of 2nd point becomes (1−1,1−1)=(0,0).
In the second operation, you choose i=3, and K=4 and apply the first type of operation. So the location of 3rd point becomes (−4+4,5)=(0,5).
In the third operation, you choose i=3, and K=−5 and apply the second type of operation. So the location of 3rd point becomes (0,5−5)=(0,0).

Hence after the above operations, the location of the given three points becomes equal to each other.
Test case 2 : 

In the first operation, you choose i=1 and K=1 and apply the first type of operation. So the location of 1st point becomes (0+1,1)=(1,1).
In the second operation, you choose i=3, and K=−2 and apply the fourth type of operation. So the location of 3rd point becomes (3−2,−1−(−2))=(1,1).

Hence after the above operations, the location of the given three points becomes equal to each other.
