Thomas Shelby is bored staying in Birmingham. He wants to travel
and asks for your help.
There are v cities numbered from 1 to v in your country. Also, there are e  roads connecting the cities. One can go from city ui to vi (and vice versa) using the i−th road. No two cities have more than one road connecting them. You can start your travel from any city. Thomas wants to travel n cities (not necessarily distinct).
Find the number of ways you can travel n cities.  
Note: You can travel one city multiple times in a single travel. (See sample test case for better understanding)
Input Format

The first line contains one integer t denoting the number of testcases
The first line contains three integers v, e ,n.
Each of the next e lines contains two integers ui, vi (1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ v; ui ≠ vi).

Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line answer ie. the number of ways you can travel n cities modulo 1000000007.
Constraints

1≤t≤10
2≤v≤40
2≤e≤ (v*(v+1))/2
2≤n≤1015
