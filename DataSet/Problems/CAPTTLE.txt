There was a great Captain Jack Sparrow who ruled the Carribean Sea and likes his Rum(alcohol) very much. In his adventures on the sea he gathered many bottles of rum and gave
it to a Keeper but soon the rumour spread that Captain is lost in the sea and now the Keeper becomes greedy of the wines he kept for the Captain.So he started selling them.As it was not confirmed that
Captain Sparrow is lost or dead he sold only a few bottles at a time because like every person on the sea he also feared the Great Captain Jack Sparrow.
Assuming Keeper had "n" bottles in a row and also decided the price of bottles depending upon quantity and type of rum. 
Therefore;
For each bottle in the row of "n" bottles, he decided the price Ai(where i=1,2,3…..n and Ai is the number of gold coins he sells the "i"th bottle ) and also decides to sell one bottle every year.
Now he sells each bottle either from the start or the end of the row so as to maximize his Profit from the gold coins which he gets after selling the rum bottles.
and the Profit he makes goes by the formula,
Profit = Y*Ai for each year (where "Y" is the current year and "Ai" is the price of the bottle he sells in that year from the start or the end of the row of the bottles.)
Output:
Your Task is to Calculate the Maximum Total number of Gold Coins the keeper will collect if he sells "n" bottles in "n" number of years by taking price of each bottle as the input.
Sample Input:
5 2 3 5 1 4  
Sample Output:
50
