"An ideal problem has no test data." - aryanc403
This is an interactive problem.
Chef likes probability puzzles a lot, almost as much as interactive problems. Today, he learned about the Monty Hall Paradox.
Suppose that Chef is participating in a game show, where he has to choose between three doors numbered 11 through 33. There is a car behind one of the doors and goats behind the other two. Chef does not know what is behind which door, but there is a game host who knows where the car is.
First, you need to help Chef pick a door (let's denote it by X). Then, the host opens a different door (let's denote it by Y) such that there is a goat behind this door, and asks Chef to pick an arbitrary door again (let's denote it by Z). You need to help Chef pick door Z too. You should do it in such a way that the probability of a car being behind door Z is maximised. If there are multiple optimal possible ways to pick doors for Chef, you may choose any one.
Interaction

First, you should print a line containing a single integer X (1≤X≤3).
Then, you should read a line containing a single integer Y.
Finally, you should print a line containing a single integer Z (1≤Z≤3).

Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!
