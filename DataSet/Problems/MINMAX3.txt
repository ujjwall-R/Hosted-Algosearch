 
Problem description.
You are given a sequence of N integers, A. You need to partition the sequence, where the cost of making a partition from L to R is AL + AR. Output the minimum and maximum total cost of making exactly K partitions where the total cost is the sum of costs of each partition.
Input
Input description.
The first line of the input contains two integesr N and K denoting the number of elements in the sequence and the number of partitions to be made respectively. N integers follow in the next line denoting the sequence.
Output
Output a single line containing two integers denoting minimum and maximum cost.
Constraints


1 ≤ N ≤ 106
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 109

Example
Input:
5 2
1 2 3 4 5

Output:
9 15



Explanation

Making the partition like this: 1 | 2 3 4 5
The above partitioning costs 1 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 9 and you can check its the minimum possible.
While making the partition like this: 1 2 3 4 | 5
The above partition costs 1 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 15 and this is the maximum possible.
