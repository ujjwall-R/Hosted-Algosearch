You are given the height HH (in metres) and mass MM (in kilograms) of Chef. The Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person is computed as MH2MH2.
Report the category into which Chef falls, based on his BMI:

Category 1: Underweight if BMI ≤18
Category 2: Normal weight if BMI ∈{19, 20,…, 24}
Category 3: Overweight if BMI ∈{25, 26,…, 29}
Category 4: Obesity if BMI ≥30

Input:

The first line of input will contain an integer, T, which denotes the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains a single line of input, with two space separated integers, M,H, which denote the mass and height of Chef respectively. 

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line, 1,2,3 or 4, based on the category in which Chef falls.
Constraints

1≤T≤2∗104
1≤M≤104
1≤H≤102
Its guaranteed that H2 divides M.

Explanation
Case 1: Since MH2=7222=18, therefore person falls in category 1.
Case 2: Since MH2=8022=20, therefore person falls in category 2.
Case 3: Since MH2=12022=30, therefore person falls in category 4.
