You are given an array AA with length NN. On each day, the following process was performed:

a new array R is created; this array contains all elements Ai such that i=1, i=N or min(Ai−1,Ai+1)≤Ai (2≤i<N), in the original order
A is replaced by R and N is replaced by the length of R

In other words, all elements of A that are between two bigger elements disappear.
For each element of the original array, calculate the number of the day on which it disappeared (the process starts with day 1), or determine that it never disappeared.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers. For each valid i, the i-th of these integers should be the number of the day on which the i-th element of the original array disappeared, or 0 if it never disappeared.
Constraints

1≤T≤1,000
1≤N≤105
the sum of N in all test cases does not exceed 105
1≤Ai≤109 for each valid i

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (20 points): the sum of N in all test cases does not exceed 1,000
Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints
