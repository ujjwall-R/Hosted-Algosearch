As we all know, Chefland consists of NN cities (numbered 11 through N) connected by N−1 roads in such a way that each city is reachable from all other cities. In other words, the cities and roads form a tree. For each valid i, the i-th city's height above sea level is Ai.
A path between two cities is said to be beautiful if the heights of the cities in the path first increase and then decrease. In other words, when we denote the sequence of cities the path passes through by x1,x2,…,xL, it is beautiful if Ax1<Ax2<…<Axp>…>AxL−1>AxL holds for some integer p (1≤p≤L).
Chefina is planning a trip along a path in the tree. You should answer Q queries. In each query, you are given two cities x and y and you should tell Chefina if the simple path between these cities is beautiful.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
Each of the following N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting that cities u and v are connected by a road.
The next line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
Each of the following Q lines contains two space-separated integers x and y describing a query.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing a string with length Q. For each valid i, the i-th character of this string should be '1' if the path in the i-th query is beautiful or '0' otherwise.
Constraints

1≤T≤200
1≤N,Q≤105
1≤u,v≤N
1≤x,y≤N
1≤Ai≤109 for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106
the sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 106

Explanation
Example case 1: The sequence of heights of cities on the path from city 1 to city 5 is [4,5], and 4<5 holds, so it is a beautiful path.
Example case 2: The sequence of heights of cities on the path from city 3 to city 4 is [2,6,1], and 2<6>1, so it is a beautiful path.
