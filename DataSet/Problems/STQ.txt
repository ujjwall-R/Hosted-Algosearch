You are given an array A of N positive integers. You are allowed to perform any of the following operations any number of times:

Pick an index i (1≤i≤n), and a prime number p. Assign Ai×p to Ai.
Pick an index i (1≤i≤n), and a prime number p such that Ai is divisible by p. Assign Ai÷p to ai.

The goal is to make all the numbers in array equal using the minimum number of operations. Among all sequences of operations using the minimum number of operations, denote S to be the smallest final value of all elements in A. You are given Q queries of the form (Li,Ri). For each query, you need to calculate the S value of the contiguous subarray ALi…Ri.
Input Format

The first line contains N and Q denoting the number of elements in the array and number of queries.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN denoting the given array.
Q lines follow. The i-th line contains two space-separated integers Li and Ri denoting the i-th query.

Output Format
For each query, output the value S for the subarray on a single line.
Constraints

1≤N≤106
1≤Q≤2⋅105
1≤Li≤Ri≤N
1≤Ai≤106

77
11


Explanation

For the first query, there is only one sequence of operations that uses 2 operations:

Choose i=2 and p=11, assign A2×11=77 to A2.
Choose i=3 and p=7, assign A3×7=77 to A3.

We can prove that there aren't any sequence of operations that uses 1 operation, so the above sequence uses the least number of operations. The final S value is 77.

For the second query, there are two sequences of operations that uses 2 operations. Those are:

Choose i=3 and p=7, assign A3×7=77 to A3.
Choose i=4 and p=7, assign A4÷7=11 to A4.

Both of them are optimal in terms of number of operations. The first sequence of operations has the final value S to be 77, and the second sequence of operations has the final value S to be 11. Therefore, the answer to this query is 11 (we need to minimize the final value S).
