You are given a rooted tree with NN nodes (numbered 11 through NN). Node 1 is the root. You are also given integer sequences x1,x2,…,xN and v1,v2,…,vN.
Let S be a subset of nodes. It is called valid if it is non-empty and the following conditions hold:

There is no pair of nodes (i,j) such that i,j∈S and i is an ancestor of j.
The greatest common divisor of the values xi for all nodes i∈S (let's denote it by G) is greater than 1.

Next, let's define the value of S as G⋅V, where G is defined above and V=∑i∈Svi.
You need to find a valid subset of nodes with the maximum value.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
Each of the next N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting that nodes u and v are connected by an edge.
N lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers xi and vi.

Output
For each test case, print three lines.

The first of these lines should contain two space-separated integers G⋅V and G for your chosen subset.
The second line should contain a single integer K ― the size of your subset.
The third line should contain K space-separated integers ― the numbers of the nodes in this subset (in any order).

If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.
