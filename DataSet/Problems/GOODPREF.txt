You are given an integer n and a string s consisting only of characters 'a' and 'b'. Consider a string t=s+s+⋯+s⏟n times, i.e. the string obtained by concatenating n copies of s.
Find the number of non-empty prefixes of t in which the number of occurrences of 'a' is strictly greater than the number of occurrences of 'b'.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains the string s and the integer n, separated by a single space. 

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of valid prefixes.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤|s|≤103
1≤n≤109
each character of s is either 'a' or 'b'

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (30 points): 1≤n≤103
Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints

Explanation
Example case 1: The string t is "abaaba". It has five prefixes which contain more a-s than b-s: "a", "aba", "abaa", "abaab" and "abaaba".
Example case 2: The string t is "baabaabaa". The strings "baa", "baaba", "baabaa", "baabaab", "baabaaba" and "baabaabaa" are the six valid prefixes.
Example case 3: The string t is "bbabbabba". There is no prefix of this string which consists of more a-s than b-s. Therefore, the answer is zero.
