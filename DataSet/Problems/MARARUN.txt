Chefland is holding a virtual marathon for the categories 10 km, 21 km and 42 km having prizes A,B,C (A<B<C) respectively to promote physical fitness. In order to claim the prize in a particular category the person must cover the total distance for that category within D days. Also a single person cannot apply in multiple categories. 
Given the maximum distance d km that Chef can cover in a single day, find the maximum prize that Chef can win at the end of D days. If Chef can't win any prize, print 0.
Input

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
Each test case contains a single line of input, five integers D,d,A,B,C. 

Output
For each test case, output in a single line the answer to the problem.
Constraints

1≤T≤50
1≤D≤10
1≤d≤5
1≤A<B<C≤105

Explanation
Test Case 1: The maximum distance covered by Chef is 1⋅1=1 km which is less than any of the available distance categories. Hence Chef won't be able to claim a prize in any of the categories.
Test Case 2: The maximum distance covered by Chef is 10⋅1=10 km which is equal to distance of the first category. Hence Chef can claim the maximum prize of 1 units.
Test Case 3: The maximum distance covered by Chef is 10⋅3=30 km which is more than the distance of the second category but less than that of the third category. Hence Chef can claim the maximum prize of 2 units.
