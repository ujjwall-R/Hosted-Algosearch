Problem Statement:
Captain America and Iron Man are at WAR and the rage inside Iron Man is rising.

But Iron Man faces a problem to identify the location of Captain America.

There are N buildings situtaed adjacently to each other and Captain America can be at any building.

Iron Man has to arrange the Buildings from 1 to N is such a way that Value(i.e abs(Building Number -Position of Building))=K for every building.

Can You help Iron Man to Find The Arrangement of the Buildings?

P.S- If no arrangement exist, then print         
        “CAPTAIN AMERICA EVADES”.

Input Format:
  The first line of input contains a single integer,T, denoting the number of test cases.


Each of the T  subsequent lines contains 2 space-separated integers describing the respective N and K values for a test case.

Output Format:
On a new line for each test case, 
Print the lexicographically smallest arrangement; 
If no absolute arrangement exists, print “CAPTAIN AMERICA EVADES”.

Constraints:

SubTask#1
1<=T<=10

1<=N<=10^5

0<=K<=N

SubTask#2
Original Constraints..

SubTask#3
Original Constraints..


Sample Input:
3
2 1
3 0
3 2

Sample Output:

2 1
1 2 3
CAPTAIN AMERICA EVADES

Explanation:
Case 1:
N=2 and K=1
Therefore the arrangement is [2,1].

Case 2:
N=3 and K=0
Therefore arrangement is [1,2,3].
