Once Chef was going through the stuff he has in his basement and to his surprise he found N metal balls, each with different weight. Our Chef who is always searching for a way to earn money has decided to sell these balls to gain free money. To his luck, he has found a dealer who is ready to buy these balls but the dealer has agreed to buy only M number of balls. The dealer has also told Chef that lesser the difference between minimum and maximum weigth of metal balls, more money he gets.
Help Chef find M metal balls that he has to give to the dealer to gain Maximum money.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. 
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N which denotes number of metal balls.
Second line of each test case contains N space-seperated numbers that denote weight of each ball.
Third line of each test case contains a single integer N which denotes number of metal balls that the dealer want to buy 

Constraints:

1 <= T <= 100
1 <=N<= 107
1 <= A[i]<= 1018
1 <= M <= N

Output:
For each test case, print a single integer denoting minimum difference that can be achieved.
Sample Input:
 2
 9
 12 8 4 15 7 1 16 14 11
 5
 7
 1 1 2 19 13 1 4
 4

Sample Output:
 5
 1

Explanation:
  Test Case 1:  If we consider 5 metal balls of weights [12, 15, 16, 14, 11] , the minimum 
  difference between minimum and maximum weights is 16-11 = 5. So the final answer is 5.

  Test Case 2: If we consider 4 metal balls of weights [1, 1, 2, 1] , the minimum 
  difference between minimum and maximum weights is 2-1 = 1. So the final answer is 1.
