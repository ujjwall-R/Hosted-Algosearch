Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
This time, Chef has given you an array AA containing NN elements.
He had also asked you to answer M of his questions. Each question sounds like: "How many inversions will the array A contain, if we swap the elements at the ith and the jth positions?". 
The inversion is such a pair of integers (i,j) that i<j and Ai>Aj. 
Input

The first line contains two space separated integers N and M - the number of integers in the array A and the number of questions respectively. 
The second line contains N space-separated integers - A1,A2,…,AN, respectively. 
Each of next M lines describes a question by two integers i and j - the 1-based indices of the numbers we'd like to swap in this question. 

Output
Output M lines. Output the answer to the ith question of the ith line.
Constraints

1≤N,M≤2⋅105
1≤i,j≤N
1≤Ai≤109
Mind that we don't actually swap the elements, we only answer "what if" questions, so the array doesn't change after the question.

Example Input
6 3
1 4 3 3 2 5
1 1
1 3
2 5

Example Output:
5
6
0

Explanation
Inversions for the first case: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5). 
Inversions for the second case: (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2,5), (4, 5). 
In the third case the array looks like 1 2 3 3 4 5 and there are no inversions.
