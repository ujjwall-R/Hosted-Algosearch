Chef wants to take Chefina on a date. However, he has to complete one more task before leaving. Since he does not want to be late, he is asking you for help.
There are NN bags with coins in a row (numbered 11 through NN); for each valid i, the i-th bag contains Ai coins. Chef should make the number of coins in each bag divisible by a given integer K in the following way:

choose an integer c between 0 and N (inclusive)
take some coins from the first c bags ― formally, for each i (1≤i≤c), he may choose any number of coins between 0 and Ai inclusive and take them out of the i-th bag
move some of these coins to some of the last N−c bags ― formally, for each i (c+1≤i≤N), he may place a non-negative number of coins in the i-th bag

Of course, the number of coins placed in the last N−c bags must not exceed the number of coins taken out from the first c bags, but there may be some coins left over. Let's denote the number of these coins by R. You should find the smallest possible value of R.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN. 

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest value of R.
Constraints

1≤T≤103
1≤N≤105
0≤Ai≤109 for each valid i
1≤K≤109
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105

Explanation
Example case 1: One of the possible solutions is to choose c=4, remove 1, 0, 4 and 13 coins from bags 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively, and add 13 coins to bag 5.
Example case 2: The optimal solution is to choose c=3 and remove one coin from each bag.
