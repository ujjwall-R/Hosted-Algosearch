Explanation
Test Case 1: Out of the women, only the 1st and 2nd women are eligible for the training because their ages lie in the interval [10,60]. Hence the answer is 2.
Test Case 2: Only the 1st and 3rd women are eligible for the training because their ages lie in the interval [10,60]. Hence the answer is again 2.
Test Case 3: Only the 1st woman with age 35 is eligible for the training. Hence the answer is 1.
