This problem is similar to the problem "MNDIGSUM". The only differences are in the constraints and in the input format. In this problem the range for the base BB is [2,R][2,R], the value of nn can be upto 1012 and the total number of queries is at most 300. The differences are described in bold.
Let f(n,B) be the sum of digits of the integer n when written in base B.
More formally, if n=∞∑i=0aiBi where ai is an integer in the range [0,B−1], then f(n,B)=∞∑i=0ai.
Given Q queries, each consisting of two integers n and r. Find the value of B corresponding to which f(n,B) is minimum for all 2≤B≤r. If there are multiple such values, you can print any of them.
Input Format

The first line contains in single integer Q, the number of queries
Each of the next Q lines contain two space separated integers n and r respectively.

Output Format

For each query (n r) find the value of the base B that lies within [2,r] such that f(n,B) is minimum.

Constraints

1≤Q≤300
2≤n≤1012
2≤r≤1012

Explanation
To compute f(n,B), first write the integer n in the form a0+a1B+a2B2+… such that 0≤ai<B and ai is an integer. It can be shown that such a representation is unique. The sum of the digits is then ∞∑i=0ai (to be computed in base 10).
For example to compute f(216,2), observe that 216=27+26+24+23, and so the sum of digits is 1+1+1+1=4.
Similarly, to compute  f(216,100), write 216 as 2∗100+16 and so the sum of digits is 2+16=18.
Test case 1: We have f(216,2)=f(216,3)=4, f(216,4)=6, f(216,5)=8, f(216,6=1) and finally f(216,7)=12. Clearly the minimum is obtained when B=6.
Test case 2: Note that f(256,2)=f(256,4) = 1, therefore both the answers 2 and 4 will be considered correct.
Test case 3: f(31,3)=f(31,5)=3 and f(31,4)=7, therefore both the answers 3 and 5 will be considered correct.
