Chef has been teaching probability and expectation in his class. He wants his N students (numbered 1 through N) to play a game so that they could understand the concepts clearly.
For each valid i, the i-th student should choose an integer from a range [Li,Ri] uniformly randomly. Chef wants to know the expected value of the ratio A/B, where A is the product of the integers chosen by the students and B is the GCD of these integers. Please help him calculate it.
It can be proved that this expected value can be expressed as a fraction PQ, where P and Q are positive integers and Q is coprime with 998,244,353. You should compute P⋅Q−1 modulo 998,244,353, where Q−1 denotes the multiplicative inverse of Q modulo 998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
N lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Li and Ri.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer P⋅Q−1 modulo 998,244,353.

Explanation
Example case 1: There are three possible scenarios: student 1 can choose 1, 2 or 3. In all of them, A=B, so the expected value is 1.
Example case 2: There are three possible scenarios:

Student 1 chooses 2, student 2 chooses 5: AB=2⋅5gcd(2,5)=10.
Student 1 chooses 3, student 2 chooses 5: AB=3⋅5gcd(3,5)=15.
Student 1 chooses 4, student 2 chooses 5: AB=4⋅5gcd(4,5)=20.

The expected value of the ratio is 10+15+203=15.
