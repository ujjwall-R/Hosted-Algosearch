What the Kryptonians need is to be together, to be united in order to save the apocalypse.
For that, Seg-El has decided to carry out some encoding. The people of the same behavior if made to stay together will lead to enhanced protection of Krypton. 
 There are N people on Krypton. Each has a behavior A[i] associated with him/her.
You need to tell Seg-El the total number of ways to choose any two people of same behavior so that they can be made to stay together.
 
Input
First line consists of N - the number of people.
Second line comprises N space separated integers denoting A[i].
 
Output
Print the answer to the number of ways to place 2 people together having same behaviour.
 
Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1015

 
Example
Input:
4
1 1 2 2
Output:
 2 
Explanation
There is only 1 way in which 2 people with behavior 1 can be together. Similarly, for behavior 2 people. Hence, total number of ways are 2.
