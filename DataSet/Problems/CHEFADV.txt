Mysterious Chefland… Recently, Chef realised that Discuss, the educational system of Chefland, is out of date. Therefore, he is trying to find ways to update the infrastructure in the country. One possible way is to move all materials from Discuss to Discourse.
Chef will have access to Discourse if his knowledge and power become exactly equal to N and M respectively. Initially, he has power 1 and knowledge 1.
Chef can perform actions of the following types to improve his skills:

solve a problem — increase his knowledge by X
do a push-up — increase his power by Y
install ShareChat to keep in touch with friends — increase both knowledge and power by 1

Chef can only install ShareChat at most once. The remaining actions may be performed any number of times and the actions may be performed in any order.
Help Chef find out whether it is possible to move from Discuss to Discourse.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers N, M, X and Y.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Chefirnemo" if it is possible to reach the required knowledge and power or "Pofik" if it is impossible.
Constraints

1≤T≤1,000
1≤N,M,X,Y≤109

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (30 points): 1≤N,M,X,Y≤100
Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints

Explanation
Example case 2: We add Y=9 once to the power to get power 10. We add X=5 twice to the knowledge to get knowledge 11.
Example case 3: We can see that it is impossible to reach power M=11 no matter which or how many operations we do. Note that the ShareChat operation will increase both knowledge and power by 1, and hence it will still be impossible to attain the given values of knowledge and power at the same time.
Example case 4: We can reach knowledge 11 and power 10 like in example case 2, the only difference is that we also use the ShareChat operation to increase both by 1.
