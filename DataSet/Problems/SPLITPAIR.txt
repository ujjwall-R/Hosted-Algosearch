You are given a positive integer NN. You have to split each digit of NN into either of two non-empty subsequences A or B.  
For example, if N=104, some possible values of (A,B) can be (10,4),(14,0) and (1,4). Note that, after separating the digits into A and B, these subsequences are considered as positive integers and thus leading zeros can be omitted.
Let us define a function F(X,Y)=(X+Y)%2. Find out whether it is possible to find two non-empty subsequences A and B formed out of N such that F(A,B)=0.
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains of a single line of input, one integer N.

Output Format
For each test case, print YES if it is possible to find two non-empty subsequences A and B formed out of N such that F(A,B)=0. Otherwise, print NO.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YeS, yEs, yes and YES will all be treated as identical).

YES


Explanation
Test Case 1: The only two possibilities are:

A=0,B=1: Here F(A,B)=(A+B)%2=(0+1)%2=1%2=1. 
A=1,B=0: Here F(A,B)=(A+B)%2=(1+0)%2=1%2=1. 
Hence it's not possible to achieve F(A,B)=0.

Test Case 2: One of the possible ways to split the digits of N such that F(A,B)=0 is:

A=74,B=352: Here F(A,B)=(A+B)%2=(74+352)%2=426%2=0.
