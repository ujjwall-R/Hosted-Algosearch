You are given a permutation (P1,P2,…,PN)(P1,P2,…,PN). In one operation, you can do the following:

Choose any integers L,RL,R with 1≤L≤R≤N. Then, swap the maximum and minimum elements in subarray P[L:R].

Sort the permutation. You can spend at most 4⋅106 operations in total for all test cases from a single input.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T − the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line of each test case contains N integers P1,P2,…,PN − the elements of the permutation.

Output Format
For each test case, in the first line output K − the number of operations.
In each of the next K lines, output two integers L,R (1≤L≤R≤N), denoting that you are swapping maximum and minimum in segment P[L:R].
Sum of K over all test cases can't exceed 4⋅106.
Constraints

1≤T≤30000
1≤N≤30000
1≤Pi≤N, all Pi are distinct
The sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 30000.

Explanation
In the first test case, the permutation is already sorted.
In the second test case:

In the first operation we are swapping maximum and minimum on segment P[1:4] − those are 4 and 1 correspondently. So, now the permutation becomes (1,4,2,3).
In the second operation we are swapping maximum and minimum on segment P[2:4] − those are 4 and 2 correspondently. So, now the permutation becomes (1,2,4,3).
In the third operation we are swapping maximum and minimum on segment P[3:4] − those are 4 and 3 correspondently. So, now the permutation becomes (1,2,3,4).

In the third test case, it's enough to apply the operation once for the entire segment P[1:5], swapping 5 and 1.
