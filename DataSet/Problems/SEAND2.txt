 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.

Sereja has an integer number A that doesn't contain zeroes in its decimal form. 
Also he has N integers B[1], B[2], ..., B[N]. 


Let us first define function f for a number A as follows. 
.


Now he has to reorder the digits of A such that f(A) is minimum. 
Please help him in finding most optimal A.
 
Input

First line contain a single integer T denoting number of test cases. Then T tests follow.  
First line of each test case contains an integer A. 
Next line contains an integer N. 
Next line contains N integers B[1], B[2], ..., B[N].  

Output
For each test case, output optimal value of A after reordering digits in a single line.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ A ≤ 101000
N = 100
1 ≤ B[i] ≤ 106
Example
Input:
2
123
2
2 3
123457
1
10

Output:
312
754312


Scoring

Let Y denotes your score for the problem. Y is defined as sum of f(optimal A)) for all test cases. 
You objective is to make Y as small as possible.

Tests generation Plan

Test set contains five official test cases. 
During the contest, your solution will be tested only on the first test. After the end of contest, it will be re-judged on the full test set. 


Length of number A is generated randomly. All digits of it are also chosen randomly. 


In all test cases N is equal to 100. 


To generate array B, first we chose an integer R between 1 and 106 inclusive. Note that R is 
not randomly generated, it will be manually selected. 

Then all elements of array B are chosen in range 1..R randomly.
