Chef has a tree GG with NN nodes (numbered 11 through N) and N−1 undirected edges. For each node u in the tree, he can assign directions to the edges in such a way that u is reachable from all the other nodes. Let Cu be the number of valid topological orderings in the resulting directed acyclic graph.
This way, Chef obtains N pairs (C1,1),(C2,2),…,(CN,N) and he sorts all these pairs (Ci,i) in descending order (first by Ci and in the case of a tie by i). 
For example, consider the tree below:

The sorted list of pairs is ((2,2),(1,3),(1,1)).
Chef quizzes you on this list ― he wants you to find the K-th pair in the sorted list. To make that task easier, Chef only asks for K=1 (the largest pair) or K=2 (the second largest pair). Since the number of topological orderings can be very large, compute it modulo 109+7. 
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
Each of the next N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v, denoting that nodes u and v are connected by an edge.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing two space-separated integers u and Cu modulo 109+7, where (Cu,u) is the K-th pair in the sorted list.

1≤N≤5⋅105
1≤K≤2
1≤u,v≤N

Explanation
Example case 1: The tree is


For u=1, there are C1=2 possible topological orderings: (3,4,2,1) and (4,3,2,1)
For u=2, there are C2=6 possible topological orderings: (3,4,1,2), (4,3,1,2), (3,1,4,2), (4,1,3,2), (1,3,4,2) and (1,4,3,2).
For u=3, there are C3=2 possible topological orderings: (1,4,2,3) and (4,1,2,3).
For u=4, there are C4=2 possible topological orderings: (3,1,2,4) and (1,3,2,4).

The sorted list of pairs is ((6,2),(2,4),(2,3),(2,1)). The node for the 2-nd pair is 4 and the corresponding number of topological orderings modulo 109+7 is 2.
