There are NN buckets numbered 11 through NN. The buckets contain balls; each ball has a color between 1 and K. Let's denote the number of balls with color j that are initially in bucket i by ai,j.
For each i from 1 to N−1 (in this order), someone draws a ball uniformly at random from bucket i and puts it into bucket i+1, then continues to draw the next ball. After putting a ball in bucket N, this person draws a ball, again uniformly at random, from bucket N.
For each color from 1 to K, find the probability that the ball drawn from bucket N has this color.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and K. 
N lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤N), the i-th of these lines contains K space-separated integers ai,1,ai,2,…,ai,K.

Output
Print a single line containing K space-separated real numbers. For each valid i, the i-th of these numbers should denote the probability that the last drawn ball has color i. your answer will be considered correct if absolute or relative error does not exceed 10−6
Constraints

1≤N,K≤1,000
