It's the soccer match finals in Chefland and as always it has reached the penalty shotouts. 
Each team is given 55 shots to make and the team scoring a goal on the maximum number of shots wins the game. If both the teams' scores are equal, then the game is considered a draw and we would have 22 champions.
Given ten integers A1,A2,…,A10A1,A2,…,A10, where the odd indexed integers(A1,A3, A5, A7,A9) represent the outcome of the shots made by team 1 and even indexed integers(A2,A4,A6,A8,A10) represent the outcome of the shots made by team 2 (here Ai=1 indicates that it's a goal and Ai=0 indicates a miss), determine the winner or find if the game ends in a draw. 
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains ten space-separated integers A1,A2,…,A10.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - 0 if the game ends in a draw or 1 if the first team wins or 2 if the second team wins.

Explanation
Test case 1: No team scores any goal, so the game ends in a draw.
Test case 2: The second team is able to score in their final shot, while the first team has scored 0 goals and hence the second team wins.
Test case 3: The first team is successfully able to make their first 2 shots count and whereas the second team has not scored any goals. Therefore the first team wins.
Test case 4: Team 2 misses their final shot and hence team 1 wins the game with the final score of 5−4.
