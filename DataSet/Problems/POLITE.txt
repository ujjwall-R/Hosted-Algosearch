A polite number is a positive integer that can be written as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. Suppose for 77 and 1515:

7=3+47=3+4
15=4+5+615=4+5+6

So, 7 and 15 are polite number. While 1 can not be written as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. So it is not polite. You will be given a positive integer N. Now you have to tell how many positive integers from 1 to N are not polite.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains of a single integers N. 

Output:
For each testcase, output a single integer answering how many numbers from 1 to N are not polite.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤N≤1018

Sample Input:
1
100

Sample Output:
7
