NehaNeha  is given a number NN. She always looks for special thing , this time she is looking for SpecialSpecial Number and Partial Special Number. A Special Number is a number whose product of its digits is equal to number itself i.e. N, and in this number there is no digit 1. Partial Special is a number having all the condition same as Special except that it must have digit 1 in it .Neha have to count the number of Special and Partial Special Numbersfor a given  N . She is not so good in programming , so go and help her.
Input:

Integers N is taken as input from input stream. 

Output:

Print the number of  Special and Partial Special Numbersfor a given  N.

Constraints

1≤N≤100 numbers to be count will be less then 10^6

Sample Input:
3

Sample Output:
1 20

EXPLANATION:
There are only one natural numbers, the product of the digits of which is 3  :- {3}.
There are 20 natural numbers with digit 1 , whose  product of the digits  is 3 :-{13, 31, 113 ,131 311 ,1113 ,1131 ,1311, 3111 ,11113, 11131, 11311 ,13111, 31111, 111113, 111131, 111311,113111, 131111 ,311111}
