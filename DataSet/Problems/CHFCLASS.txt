Explanation
Test case 1: The month consists of 5 days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday). Since there are no Saturdays, Akash would go to school every day. Thus, he takes a leave for 0 days.
Test case 2: The month consists of 6 days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday). Akash takes a leave only on Saturday. Thus, he takes a leave for 1 day.
Test case 3: The month consists of 8 days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday). Akash takes a leave only on Saturday. Thus, he takes a leave for 1 day.
