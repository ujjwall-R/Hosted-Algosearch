This is an interactive problem.
When Vivek was creating the problem LAZER, he realised that it can be used to create a different, interactive problem. Can you solve this problem too?
Let's frame this problem formally. You are given integers N, M, K and Q. Consider a random sequence A1,A2,…,AN, where each element is generated independently and uniformly randomly between 1 and M (inclusive). As described in the problem statement of LAZER, we create line segments between pairs of points (i,Ai) and (i+1,Ai+1) for each valid i.
The height of a line segment connecting points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is defined as |y1−y2|. You are given Q queries. In each query, you are given integers L and R; you should consider the line segments such that the x-coordinates of their endpoints lie between L and R inclusive, and you should find the maximum of heights of these segments.
Your task is to answer these queries. However, the sequence A is hidden and you may only ask at most K questions (of a different type from the queries you should answer). In each of your questions:

You should choose integers x1, x2 and y, where 1≤x1<x2≤N and 1≤y≤109.
Consider a laser beam fired horizontally to the right from the point (x1,y), which stops at the point (x2,y) and does not propagate further.
This beam collides with zero or more of the line segments described above. The beam is considered to collide with a line segment if it intersects or touches this segment, except when the left endpoint of this segment is (x2,y) or its right endpoint is (x1,y).
The answer to this question is the maximum of heights of the segments with which it collides or the information that it does not collide with any segments.

Interaction

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of interaction for T test cases follows.
For each test case, you should start by reading a line containing four space-separated integers N, M, K and Q. 
Then, you should read Q lines. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers L and R describing one of the queries which you should answer.
Then, you may ask questions.
To ask a question, you should print a line containing four space-separated integers 1, x1, x2 and y.
Then, you should read a line containing a single integer H.
If the question was invalid or if you asked too many questions, H=−1.
Otherwise, if the beam in this question does not collide with any segments, then H=−2.
Otherwise, H is the maximum of heights of the segments with which the beam collides.
When you have determined the answer, you should print a line containing Q+1 space-separated integers 2, ans1, ans2, …, ansQ, where for each valid i, ansi is the answer to the i-th query. This does not count as a question.
Finally, you should read a line containing a single integer: 1 if your answer is correct or −1 if it is incorrect. If your answer was correct, you should continue solving the remaining test cases.

Note that when you receive −1 (either as the response to a question or to your answer), you should immediately terminate your program to receive a Wrong Answer verdict; otherwise, you may receive any verdict.
Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!

Explanation
Example case 1: The hidden sequence A is [1,1,1,2]. Since by asking x1=1, x2=2 and y=1, we got the answer 0, it obviously means that the answer to the first query is 0. Similarly, since by asking x1=3, x2=4 and y=2, we got the answer 1, which is the largest possible height of a line segment here, the answer to the second query is 1. The answer to the third query cannot be smaller than the answer to the second query, so it is also 1.
