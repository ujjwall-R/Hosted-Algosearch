Chef, being a Chess fan, was thrilled after he read the following news:
Michael Simkin, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University’s Center of Mathematical Sciences and Applications proved that for a large value of NN, there are approximately (0.143⋅N)N(0.143⋅N)N configurations in which N queens can be placed on a N×N chessboard so that none attack each other.
Although the formula is valid for large N, Chef is interested in finding the value of function f(N) = (0.143⋅N)N for a given small value of N. Since Chef is busy understanding the proof of the formula, please help him calculate this value.
Print the answer rounded to the nearest integer. That is, if the actual value of f(N) is x,

Print ⌊x⌋ if x−⌊x⌋<0.5
Otherwise, print ⌊x⌋+1

where ⌊x⌋ denotes the floor of x.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line of input containing one integer N.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the value of f(N) rounded to the nearest integer.

Explanation
Test case 1: f(N)=(0.143⋅4)4=0.107, which when rounded to nearest integer gives 0.
Test case 2: f(N)=(0.143⋅10)10=35.7569, which when rounded to nearest integer gives 36.
