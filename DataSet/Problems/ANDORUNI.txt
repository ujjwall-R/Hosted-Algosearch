You are given an array A consisting of N integers.
From array A, we create a new array B containing all pairwise bitwise ANDs of elements from A. That is, B consists of N⋅(N−1)/2 elements, each of the form Ai&Aj for some 1≤i<j≤N.
In array B, we repeat the following process till there is only one element remaining:

Let the current maximum and minimum element of array B be X and Y respectively.
Remove X and Y from array B and insert X|Y into it.

Determine the last remaining element in array B.
Here, & denotes the Bitwise AND operation and | denotes the Bitwise OR operation.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, denoting the number of elements in A.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the last remaining element in array B.
Constraints

1≤T≤104
2≤N≤105
0≤Ai≤109
The sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

Explanation
Test Case 1: Array B will be [A1&A2]=[1&3]=[1]. There is only one element in B so the answer is 1.
Test Case 2: Array B will be [A1&A2,A1&A3,A2&A3]=[2&7,2&1,7&1]=[2,0,1].
Then, we do the following operations on B:

Remove 2 and 0 from B and insert 2|0=2 into it. Now, B=[1,2].
Remove 2 and 1 from B and insert 2|1=3 into it. Now, B=[3].

The last remaining element is thus 3.
