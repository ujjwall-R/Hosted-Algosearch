Alisha has a string of length n. Each character is either 'a', 'b' or 'c'. She has to select two characters s[i] and s[j] such that s[i] != s[j] and i,j are valid indexes. She has to find the maximum value of the absolute difference between i and j i.e abs(i-j) .
Since Alisha is busy with her Semester exams help her find the maximum distance where distance is the maximum value of absolute difference between i and j  i.e abs(i-j) .
Input:

The first and the only line contains the string s with each character either 'a', 'b', or 'c'. 

Output:
Print a single integer the maximum absolute difference between i and j. 
Constraints

1≤n≤1051≤n≤105
