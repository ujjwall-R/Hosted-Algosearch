Arya has a pet mouse named Jack. She put Jack in a grid with NN rows (numbered 11 through NN) and M columns (numbered 1 through M). There are K cheese wedges scattered over the grid; for each wedge, we know how long it takes Jack to eat it.
Let's denote the cell in row r and column c by (r,c). Initially, Jack is in the cell (1,1). When Jack is in a cell (r,c), he can move to either of the cells (r,c−1) or (r,c+1) in 1 second. If he is in the first or last column of the grid (c=1 or c=M), he can also move to the cell (r+1,c) in 1 second. Jack can only eat a cheese wedge if he is in the same cell as the wedge.
Your task is to help Jack find out, for each possible i, the minimum number of seconds Jack needs to eat i cheese wedges.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M and K.
K lines follow. Each of these lines contains three space-separated integers r, c and t, denoting that there is a cheese wedge in cell (r,c) and it takes Jack t seconds to eat it.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing K space-separated integers. For each i (1≤i≤K), the i-th of them should denote the minimum number of seconds Jack needs to eat i cheese wedges.
