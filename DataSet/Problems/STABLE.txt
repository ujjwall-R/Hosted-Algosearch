There is an array of size NN.
We have to make all the elements in the array equal.
In one step you can select a particular index idxidx from the array and do one of the following.

Replace array[idx] by array[idx]∗x where x is any prime number.
Replace array[idx] by array[idx]/y where y is any prime divisor of array[idx](if exists)  

Find out the minimum number of steps required to make all the elements of the array equal.
Input:

First line will contain N, the size of the array. 
Second line will contain N space separated integers representing the elements of the array. 

Output:
Print one integer, the minimum number of steps to make all elements in the array equal.
Constraints

1≤N≤100000
1≤array[i]≤100000

Sample Input:
3
2 4 3

Sample Output:
3

EXPLANATION:
One possible set of operations : 

replace 3 by 1(divide 3 by 3)
replace 1 by 2(multiply 2 to 1)
replace 4 by 2(divide 4 by 2)
