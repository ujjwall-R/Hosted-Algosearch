Once upon a time, in a land far, far away… nevermind, we don't recall the rest of the story.
All we know is that Chef has a matrix of integers MM with NN rows and N columns; he wants to take a single element from each row and a single element from each column (N elements in total) and find their bitwise XOR. Find the set of all values he could obtain.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N. 
N lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤N), the i-th of the following lines contains N space-separated integers Mi,1,Mi,2,…,Mi,N.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one or more space-separated integers in increasing order — the obtainable values.

Explanation
Example case 1: We could choose M1,1=5 and M2,2=7; since we are only allowed to choose one element from each row and one from each column, we cannot choose anything else from rows 1, 2 and columns 1, 2, so we have to choose M3,3=0. Their XOR is 5⊕7⊕0=2.
Another combination could be M1,3=15, M2,1=19 and M3,2=0. Their XOR is 15⊕19⊕0=28.
