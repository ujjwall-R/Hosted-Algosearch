For a given array B1,B2,…,BMB1,B2,…,BM of length at least 33, let's define its weight as the largest value of (Bi−Bj)⋅(Bj−Bk)(Bi−Bj)⋅(Bj−Bk) over all possible triples (i,j,k) with 1≤i,j,k≤M and i≠j,j≠k,k≠i. 
You are given a sorted array A1,A2,…,AN (that is, A1≤A2≤…≤AN). 
Calculate the sum of weights of all contiguous subarrays of A of length at least 3. That is, count the sum of weights of arrays [Ai,Ai+1,…,Aj] over all 1≤i<j≤N with j−i≥2.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing the sum of weights of all subarrays of A of length at least 3.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
3≤N≤3000
1≤A1≤A2…≤AN≤106.
Sum of N over all test cases won't exceed 6000.

Explanation
 Explanation of the first test case of the sample: 

Given array has 3 subarrays of length at least 3.


 [1,2,3] has weight 1, with i=1,j=2,k=3: (1−2)⋅(2−3)=1 
 [2,3,4] has weight 1, with i=3,j=2,k=1: (4−3)⋅(3−2)=1 
 [1,2,3,4] has weight 2, with i=1,j=2,k=4: (1−2)⋅(2−4)=2, or with i=1,j=3,k=4: (1−3)⋅(3−4)=2
