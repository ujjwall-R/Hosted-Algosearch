It's Valentine's Month, and so Chef wants to gift a string to Chefina. He knows that Chefina likes palindromic strings. Chef has a string S consisting of digits from 0 to 9. He wants to convert this to a palindrome by performing zero or more operations, where an operation is defined as follows:

Pick any digit and replace all of its occurrences with any other digit.

For example, if S=12123, in one move it can be turned into 14143 or 12128, but not 32123.
You are also given N integers cost1,cost2,…,costN, where the cost of performing an operation that replaces X characters is costX.
Your task is to help Chef minimize the cost of converting his string to a palindrome.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of 3 lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, denoting the length of the string.
The second line of each test case contains a string of length N, consisting of only the digits 0 to 9.
The third line of each test case contains N space-separated integers, denoting the cost array.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the answer — the minimum cost to convert the string to a palindrome.
Constraints

1≤T≤103
1≤N≤105
S contains only the digits 0 to 9
1≤costi≤105
The sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅105

Explanation
Test case 1: Replace all occurrences of 7 with 2 and then replace all occurrences of 2 with 5, making the final string 5555. The cost of doing this is 1+4=5.
Test case 2: The cost is 0 since the given string is already a palindrome.
Test case 3: We perform the following operations:

Replace 2 with 0 with a cost of 1.
Replace 0 with 3 with a cost of 3.
Replace 3 with 4 with a cost of 2.
Replace 4 with 7 with a cost of 1.

Therefore, the total cost is 1+3+2+1=7.
Test case 4: We can replace all occurrences of 1 with 2, incurring a total cost of 3.
In all the examples above, it can be shown that it is not possible to convert the string to a palindrome at a lower cost.
