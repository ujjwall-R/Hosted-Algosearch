You are given two integer sequences A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN.
We define the similarity of the sequences A and B as the number of indices i such that Ai=Bi.
You should process Q queries. In each query, you are given parameters l, r and c; you should change each of the elements Al,Al+1,…,Ar to c, and then compute the similarity of the sequences A and B.
Chef knows that this is simple, so he asks you to answer the queries online. Note that the input is given in a special format to ensure that.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
The third line contains N space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BN.
Each of the next Q lines contains three space-separated integers x, y and z describing a query in the following format:
Let's denote the similarity of A and B before this query by Pr (for the first query, Pr is the similarity of the initial sequences).
For this query, l=x⊕Pr, r=y⊕Pr and c=z⊕Pr.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the similarity after this query.

Explanation
Example case 1: The similarity before any query is applied is 2 (the sequences match at positions 1 and 3).
In the first query, l=2, r=3, c=2. The similarity after this query is 1 (the only match is at position 1).
In the second query, l=1, r=4, c=2. The similarity after this query is 0 (no match at any position).
In the third query, l=1, r=4, c=1. The similarity after this query is 2 (two matches at positions 1 and 2).
