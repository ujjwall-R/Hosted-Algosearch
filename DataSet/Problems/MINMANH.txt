You are given two sets of points SS and TT on the xyxy-plane. SS contains NN points and TT contains  MM points.
The points (xi,yi)(xi,yi) in TT have a special property - for every 1≤i<M, xi+1>xi and yi+1<yi.
For each point (x,y)∈T, find the minimum Manhattan distance between (x,y) and a point in S. Formally, for each (x,y)∈T, find
min(xi,yi)∈S(|x−xi|+|y−yi|)
Input Format

The first line of input contains two space-separated integers N and M - the size of S and T, respectively.
The next N lines each contain two space-separated integers xi and yi, representing the points of S.
The last M lines each contain two space-separated integers xi and yi, representing the points of T.

Output Format

For each test case, output M lines. The i-th of these lines should contain a single integer, the minimum Manhattan distance between the i-th point in T and a point in set S.

Explanation
The sets are S={(0,0),(1,1)} and T={(0,1),(1,0)}. Every point in S is at a (Manhattan) distance of 1 from every point in T.

Explanation
The sets are S={(2,2),(3,3),(3,1)} and T={(0,3),(3,1),(5,0)}. 

The point closest to (0,3) is (3,3), with distance 3
The point (3,1) in S coincides with the point (3,1) in set T.
The point closest to (5,0) is (3,1), with distance 3


The points in red are the points of the set S and those in blue belong to set T. The green-coloured line segments represent the Manhattan distance between two points.
