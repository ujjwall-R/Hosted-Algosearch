Rubik’s cube is a 3x3x3 cube which has 6 different color for each face.The Rubik’s cube is made from 26 smaller pieces which are called cubies. There are 6 cubies at the centre of each face and these comprise of a single color. There are 8 cubies at the 8 corners which comprise of exactly 3 colors. The 12 reamaining cubies comprise of exactly 2 colors.
Apple has come up with a variation of the Rubik’s Cube, it’s the Rubik’s cuboid which has different colors on its 6 faces. The Rubik’s Cuboid comes in various sizes represented by M x N x O (M,N,O are natural numbers). Apple is giving away 100 Rubik’s cuboid for free to people who can answer a simple questions. Apple wants to know, in a Rubik’s cuboid with arbitrary dimensions, how many cubies would be there, which comprise of exactly 2 color.
 
Input
The input contains several test cases.The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case comprises of 3 natural numbers, M,N & O, which denote the dimensions of the Rubiks Cuboid.

Output
For each test case you are required to output the number of  cubies which comprise of 2 squares, each of which is of a different color.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ <1000
1 ≤ M ≤ <100000
1 ≤ N ≤ <100000
1 ≤ O ≤ <100000
