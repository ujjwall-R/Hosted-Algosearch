Given an array of n non-negative integers: A1, A2, …, AN. Your mission is finding a pair of integers Au, Av (1 ≤  u < v ≤ N) such that (Au and Av) is as large as possible.
And is a bit-wise operation which is corresponding to & in C++ and Java.

 
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer N. The ith line in the next N lines contains the Ai.
Output
Contains a single integer which is the largest value of Au and Av where 1 ≤  u < v ≤ N.
Constraints
50 points:
2 ≤ N ≤ 5000
0 ≤ Ai ≤ 109
50 points:
2 ≤ N ≤ 3 × 105
0 ≤ Ai ≤ 109
