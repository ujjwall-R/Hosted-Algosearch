All strings in Chefland are beautiful because they are binary strings (a binary string contains only characters '0' and '1'). The beauty of a binary string SS is defined as the number of pairs (i,j)(i,j) (1≤i≤j≤|S|) such that the substring Si,Si+1,…,Sj is special.
For a binary string U, let's denote the number of occurrences of the characters '1' and '0' in U by cnt1 and cnt0 respectively; then, U is special if cnt0=cnt1⋅cnt1.
Today, Chef's friend Araspa is celebrating her birthday. Chef wants to give Araspa the most beautiful binary string he can find. Currently, he is checking out binary strings in a shop, but he needs your help to calculate their beauties. Tell Chef the beauty of each binary string he gives you.
