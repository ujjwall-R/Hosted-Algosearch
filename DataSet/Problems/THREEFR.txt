Read problems statements Mandarin , Bengali , Hindi , Russian and Vietnamese as well.
There are three friends; let's call them A, B, C. They made the following statements:

A: "I have xx Rupees more than B."
B: "I have yy rupees more than C."
C: "I have z rupees more than A."

You do not know the exact values of x,y,z. Instead, you are given their absolute values, i.e. X=|x|, Y=|y| and Z=|z|. Note that x, y, z may be negative; "having −r rupees more" is the same as "having r rupees less".
Find out if there is some way to assign amounts of money to A, B, C such that all of their statements are true.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers X, Y and Z.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "yes" if the presented scenario is possible or "no" otherwise (without quotes).
Constraints

1≤T≤1,000
1≤X,Y,Z≤1,000

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (30 points):

1≤T≤30
1≤X,Y,Z≤3

Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints

                        Sample Input 1
                        





2
1 2 1
1 1 1



                        Sample Output 1
                        





yes
no


Explanation
Example 1: One possible way to satisfy all conditions is: A has 10 rupees, B has 9 rupees and C has 11 rupees. Therefore, we have x=1, y=−2, z=1.
Example 2: There is no way for all conditions to be satisfied.
