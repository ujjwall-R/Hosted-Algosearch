Chef is playing a game, which he starts with a score of S=0S=0. He also has an integer NN.
In one move, Chef does the following:

Uniformly randomly pick an integer XX between 0 and 2N−1 (inclusive of both ends)
Update his score as S→S∣X, where ∣ denotes the bitwise OR operation

For example, if Chef's current score is S=6 and he picks X=10, his new score is 6∣10=14.
Chef stops when his score S becomes equal to 2N−1.  What is the expected number of moves Chef performs?
Output the answer modulo 109+7. That is, the answer can be expressed as a fraction P/Q, where gcd(Q,109+7)=1. Print P⋅Q−1(mod 109+7), where Q−1 denotes the modular multiplicative inverse of Q with respect to 109+7.
Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case contains a single integer N.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the expected number of moves Chef performs, modulo 109+7.

Explanation
Test case 1: In each move, Chef chooses either 0 or 1, each with a probability of 1/2. The game ends as soon as Chef chooses 1. Thus, the probability that the game takes exactly k moves is 2−k.
The required expected value is then ∞∑k=1k⋅2−k, which equals 2. 
Test case 2: In each move, Chef chooses an integer in [0,3]. The answer is 8/3.
