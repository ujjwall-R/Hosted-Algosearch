A number MM is said to be a Mystical Number with respect to a number XX if (M⊕X)>(M&X)(M⊕X)>(M&X).
You are given an array A of size N. You are also given Q queries. Each query consists of three integers L, R, and X.
For each query, find the count of Mystical Numbers in the subarray A[L:R] with respect to the number X. 
Notes:

⊕ represents the Bitwise XOR operation and & represents the Bitwise AND operation.
A[L:R] denotes the subarray A[L],A[L+1],…,A[R].

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the size of the array A.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN denoting the array A.
The third line of each test case contains an integer Q - denoting the number of queries.
The ith of the next Q lines contains three space-separated integers L , R and X.

Output Format
For each testcase, 

For each query, print in a new line, the count of Mystical Numbers among A[L],A[L+1],…,A[R] with respect to the number X. 

Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤N≤2⋅105
0≤Ai<231
1≤Q≤2⋅105
1≤L≤R≤N
0≤X<231
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.
Sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

Explanation
Test case 1:  

Query 1: L=1,R=5,X=4. 
A1⊕X=5,A1&X=0.
A2⊕X=6,A2&X=0.
A3⊕X=7,A3&X=0.
A4⊕X=0,A4&X=4.
A5⊕X=1,A5&X=4.

Mystical numbers are A1,A2, and A3 with respect to 4. Therefore, the answer to this query is 3.

Query 2: L=2,R=5,X=2.
A2⊕X=0,A2&X=2.
A3⊕X=1,A3&X=2.
A4⊕X=6,A4&X=0.
A5⊕X=7,A5&X=0.

Mystical numbers are A4 and A5 with respect to 2. Therefore , the answer to this query is 2.
