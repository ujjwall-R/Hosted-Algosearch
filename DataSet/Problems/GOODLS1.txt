You have to solve tt cases.
In each case, you are given a string ss. You have to perform moves on the string ss, to make it a good string. 
In one move, you can delete a character from string ss.
A good string, is a string in which the number of occurrences of every character is at most 11.
Find out the minimum number of moves required to make the given string ss a goodgood string, for each test-case.
Input:

First line will contain tt, the number of test-cases.
Next tt lines, will contain a string ss.

Output:
For each test-case, output the minimum number of moves required to make string ss, a goodgood string.
Constraints:

1≤t≤1001≤t≤100
1≤length(s)≤1041≤length(s)≤104

Sample Input:
2
abc
cccdab

Sample Output:
0
2

Explanation:

For testcase−2testcase−2, you can remove any 2c′s2c′s from the string to make it goodgood. One of the resulting goodgood string(s) can be "cdab".
