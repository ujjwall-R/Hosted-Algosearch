	Chef wants to prepare a Cook-Off contest with 5 problems chosen from a set of N problems. He has marked the difficulty of each problem within a range identified by one of the following strings: "cakewalk", "simple", "easy", "easy-medium", "medium", "medium-hard", "hard". According to this page, a Cook-Off contest must have problems of the following difficulties:

exactly one "cakewalk";
exactly one "simple";
exactly one "easy";
one "easy-medium" or one "medium";
one "medium-hard" or one "hard".


	Given the information about the N problems, can you advise Chef if it's possible to pick 5 problems and form a valid Cook-Off contest?

	Input

The first line of input contains one integer T denoting the number of test cases.
T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
Then N lines follow; the i-th line contains a single string si, denoting the difficulty of the i-th problem.


	Output

	For each test case, output "Yes" if it's possible to pick 5 problems and form a valid Cook-Off contest; otherwise, output "No".

	Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100000
5 ≤ N ≤ 100000
sum of N in all test cases ≤ 600000
si can only be one of the following strings:
"cakewalk"
"simple"
"easy"
"easy-medium"
"medium"
"medium-hard"
"hard"



	Subtask #1 (11 points):

N = 5



	Subtask #2 (27 points):

5 ≤ N ≤ 15
T ≤ 100



	Subtask #3 (62 points):

                        Sample Output 1
                        





Yes
No
Yes


Explanation

Example case 2: There are neither problems of "medium-hard" level nor "hard" level, so it's impossible to form a Cook-Off contest.
