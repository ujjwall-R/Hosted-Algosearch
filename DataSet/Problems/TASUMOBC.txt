 As we all know, Binomial Coefficient C(n, r) is defined by the
following formula. 



Also define S(n) as follows. 
 

Note that n will be provided to you as an input parameter.

Since S(n) can be very large, please print it modulo (109 + 7).

Input

The first line contains a single integer T representing the number of test cases.
Each of the next T lines contains an integer n.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the value of S(n) modulo (109 + 7). 

Constraints

10 points:
1 ≤ T ≤ 300
1 ≤ n ≤ 300


30 points:
1 ≤ T ≤ 105
1 ≤ n ≤ 5000


60 points:
1 ≤ T ≤ 105
1 ≤ n ≤ 1018
