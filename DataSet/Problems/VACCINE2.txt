Finally, a COVID vaccine is out on the market and the Chefland government has asked you to form a plan to distribute it to the public as soon as possible. There are a total of NN people with ages a1,a2,…,aNa1,a2,…,aN.
There is only one hospital where vaccination is done and it is only possible to vaccinate up to D people per day. Anyone whose age is ≥80 or ≤9 is considered to be at risk. On each day, you may not vaccinate both a person who is at risk and a person who is not at risk. Find the smallest number of days needed to vaccinate everyone.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and D.
The second line contains N space-separated integers a1,a2,…,aN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest required number of days.

Explanation
Example case 1: We do not need to worry about how the people are grouped, since only one person can be vaccinated in a single day. We require as many days as there are people.
Example case 2: There are two people at risk and three people who are not at risk. One optimal strategy is to vaccinate the two people at risk on day 1 and the remaining three on the next 2 days.
