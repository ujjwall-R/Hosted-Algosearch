Chef goes to the supermarket to buy some items. Luckily there's a sale going on under which Chef gets the following offer: 

If Chef buys 33 items then he gets the item (out of those 33 items) having the lowest price as free. 

For e.g. if Chef bought 33 items with the cost 6, 2 and 4, then he would get the item with cost 2 as free. So he would only have to pay the cost of the other two items which will be 6+4=10.
Chef buys 3 items having prices A, B and C respectively. What is the amount of money Chef needs to pay?
