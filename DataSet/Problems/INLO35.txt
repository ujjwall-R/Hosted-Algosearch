 
The summer internships have just started at Google and the interns are brimming with 
energy. The swanky offices, the slides inside the building, the plethora of fun activities and 
most importantly the opportunity to work alongside some of the brightest minds, it is all like 
a dream come true for the interns.

The interns are given various tasks ranging from designing of efficient algorithms to 
suggesting a possible solution to complex problems. 2 interns, Ravi and Akshay have been 
asked to write a program. They are given 2 natural numbers N and K. They are required to 
find out the highest power of K which divides N!. 
They have solved the problem and written a good solution. Can you do it too?.
 
Input
The input contains several test cases. Each test case contains 2 space separated whole 
numbers, N and K.
Output
For each test case you need to output the highest power of K (say L) such that N! is divisible
by K^L..
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
1 < K ≤ 200

 
Example
Input:
1
12
5

Output:
2
