Chef is watching a football match. The current score is A:BA:B, that is, team 11 has scored AA goals and team 2 has scored B goals. Chef wonders if it is possible for the score to become C:D at a later point in the game (i.e. team 1 has scored C goals and team 2 has scored D goals). Can you help Chef by answering his question?
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers A and B - the intial number of goals team 1 and team 2 have scored respectively.
The second line of each test case contains two integers C and D - the final number of goals team 1 and team 2 must be able to score respectively.

Output Format
For each testcase, output POSSIBLE if it is possible for the score to become C:D at a later point in the game, IMPOSSIBLE otherwise.
You may print each character of POSSIBLE and IMPOSSIBLE in uppercase or lowercase (for example, possible, pOSsiBLe, Possible will be considered identical).

POSSIBLE
IMPOSSIBLE
POSSIBLE


Explanation
Test case 1: The current score is 1:5. If team 1 scores 2 more goals, the score will become 3:5. Thus 3:5 is a possible score.
Test case 2: The current score is 3:4. It can be proven that no non-negative pair of integers (x,y) exists such that if team 1 scores x more goals and team 2 scores y more goals the score becomes 2:6 from 3:4. Thus in this case 2:6 is an impossible score.
Test case 3: The current score is already 2:2. Hence it is a possible score.
