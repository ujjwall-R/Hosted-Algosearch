Swati loves Sstrings. She considers an ordinary string to be a Sstring if it contains the substring "SS". Now for a given string SS and an integer NN, she creates a new string S′=S+S+⋯+S⏟concatenating N times.
Swati is a very busy girl, and she doesn't have time to find whether S′ is a Sstring or not. So she asks you to check whether S′ is a Sstring or not. And if it is, find the number of occurrences of the substring "SS" in S′. Capiche?
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N.
The second line contains the string S.

Output:
For each test case print a single line containing a single integer, the number of occurrences of the substring "SS" in S′.
If S′ is not a Sstring, then print 0.
Constraints:

1≤T≤10
1≤N,|S|≤105
(|S| is the length of the string S)
S contains only uppercase English alphabets

Subtasks:

30 points: 1≤N,|S|≤100
70 points: original constraints
