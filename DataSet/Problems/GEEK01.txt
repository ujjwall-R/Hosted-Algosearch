Problem Statement
Let us define median of a square matrix M (of size N * N) as the median of the median of all rows. Given a matrix M, find it’s median.
Input section
The first line contains, T, denoting the number of test cases.
First line of each test case consists an integer N, denoting the size of the matrix. Next N lines contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of the matrix.
As the test files are upto 17 MB, it is advised to use faster input, output in C++ and Java. Time limit may be too strict for python users. You are advised to use pypy.
Output section
For each test case, print the median of the matrix, which is the median of the median of all rows.
Input constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000, N is odd.
0 ≤ A[i][j] ≤ 105, where A[i][j] deontes the element of the matrix in ith row and jth column.

Subtasks

Subtask #1 (10 points) : 1 ≤ N ≤ 3
Subtask #2 (30 points) : 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
Subtask #3 (60 points) : Original Constraints

Sample Input

17526 49346 90822
51879 9789 38513
1337 56186 53770
1
93538

Sample Output
49346
93538


For the first test case, the medians of the rows are {49346, 38513, 53770}. So the overall median of matrix is 49346.
