Lets define G(x, {A1, A2, A3, ..., Ax}) as a game played by 2 players in which we have x piles of stones with ith pile having Ai stones. Player 1 moves first. The players move alternatively. In a move a player can select a single non empty pile of stones and remove any number ( > 0 ) of stones from it. When a player cannot make a move, the player loses.

Adarsh and Saharsh are playing a modification of this game. There are N piles of stones lined up and ith pile has Ai number of stones. Saharsh needs to divide the N piles into disjoint contiguous segments. It is possible for a pile to not belong in a segment at all. The segments need to be selected in such a way such that, if ith pile is in a segment, then all the j's such that Ai = Aj, are also in the segment. Now they play games on these segments considering only the 'distinct sized piles' in the segment with Adarsh as Player 1 and Saharsh as Player 2.

Consider A = {1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2}.

A possible division is {1, 1} and {2, 3, 3, 2}. 
  For the segment {1, 1}, game G(1, {1}) would be played. For the segment {2, 3, 3, 2}, game G(2, {2, 3}) would be played.
      
G(1, {1}) would be won by Player 1
G(2, {2, 3}) would be won by Player 1

  So number of games that Player 2 wins would be 0.
Another possible division is {1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2}. 
  For the segment {1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2}, game G(3, {1, 2, 3}) would be played. 
      G(3, {1, 2, 3}) would be won by Player 2
  So number of games that Player 2 wins would be 1.


What is the maximum possible games that Saharsh can win?
