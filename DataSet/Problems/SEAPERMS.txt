Sereja has an array A of N integers: A[1], A[2], …, A[N]. Sereja also has an integer D.

Sereja calls a permutation P[1], P[2], …, P[N] as good if the following conditions hold.
A[P[1]] + D > A[P[2]],
A[P[2]] + D > A[P[3]],
⋮
A[P[N-1]] + D > A[P[N]].


Sereja wants to sequentially perform M single-element replacement operations on the array. Each of these operations consists of choosing an index p of the array, and replacing A[p] with a new value v. Your task is to keep track of the number of good permutations P[1], P[2], …, P[N] after each operation.

Input
The first line of input contains the integers N and D described above. The next line contains N integers A[1], A[2], …, A[N]. The line after this contains a single integer, M. Each of the next M lines contain two numbers p and v, implying that the new value of A[p] is v.

Output
Output M lines. The ith line should contain the number of good permutations modulo 109 + 7 after we perform the ith replacement operation.

Constraints

1 ≤ N, M ≤ 105
1 ≤ A[i], v ≤ 109
1 ≤ D  ≤ 1000
1 ≤ p ≤ N

Constraints

Subtask #1 :N, M  ≤ 10 (10 points) 
Subtask #2 :N, M  ≤ 20 (10 points) 
Subtask #3: N, M  ≤ 1000 (20 points) 
Subtask #4:  original constrains (60 points)

Explanation
Example case 1. After the first replacement operation, all permutations will be good. However, after the second operation, P[1] must be 3.
