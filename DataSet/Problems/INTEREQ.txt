Two arrays AA and BB of size NN are equivalent if for every (i,j) (1≤i<j≤N), Bi=Bj if and only if Ai=Aj. For example, [1,2,2], [10,11,11], [5,1,1] are equivalent, while [1,2,3,1], [10,20,10,10] are not.
There is a hidden array of N integers, where the elements are numbered from A1,A2,…,AN. Your task is to guess any array which is equivalent to the hidden array by asking the following query at most Q times. The elements of the guessed array must be within the range [1,109].
In each query, you give a subset of indices {i1,i2,…,ik} in the array i.e some subset of {1,2,…,N} and the judge returns the frequency of most frequent element among {Ai1,Ai2,…,Aik}. Note that the indices must be distinct and the order doesn't matter.
For example, consider the array [10,3,1,10,1,1,3].

The ouput of query {2,3,4,7} is 2. (3 occurs maximum number of times i.e 2 times)
Ouput of query {2,3,1,4,5} is 2. (Both 1 and 10 occur 2 times)

Interaction
First, you should read the number of test cases T.
For each test case, you should read two integers N and Q.
Then you may ask questions:

Output ? followed by an integer denoting the number of elements in subset followed by the indices ?ki1i2…ik.
Read an integer x denoting the answer to your query.
If the query was invalid or you have exceeded the query limit, judge prints '-1' and exits with wrong answer verdict. In this case, you must also terminate your program.

When you have determined the answer, print the character ! followed by N space-separated integers denoting the array !A1A2…AN. Note that this does not count towards a query.
Now you must read an integer denoting that your answer is correct or not.

If your answer is correct, judge prints '1'. In this case, you should continue solving the remaining test cases.
If your answer is incorrect, judge prints '-1' and exits with wrong answer verdict. You must also terminate your program in this case otherwise, you may receive any verdict. 

Constraints

1≤T≤10
2≤N≤100
Q=6N
For the given constraints, it is guaranteed that the answer can be found in the given number of queries.

Sample interaction
You       Grader
          1
          3 18
? 2 1 2
          1
? 3 1 2 3 
          2
? 2 2 3
          1
? 2 1 3
          2
! 3 4 3
          1

Explanation
The hidden array was A = [10,20,10].

We ask a query for subset {1,2}. The grader responds with 1 since both 10 and 20 occur 1 time.
Then we query for {1,2,3}. The grader responds with 2 because frequency of 10 is 2.
Then we query for {2,3}. Grader responds with 1 since both elements are distinct.
Lastly we query for {1,3} and the grader responds with 2 i.e frequency of 10.
