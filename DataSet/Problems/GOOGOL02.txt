Now, let us assume that all the free locations in the campus can be represented as a Matrix of N * M. Each element of the matrix is an integer which denotes the level of satisfaction the admin will get by constructing a building at that point. For a building whose corner points can be denoted by the points (x, y), (x, w), (z, y) and (z, w) gives a satisfaction equals to sum of all values that it encloses within these four points.
For example, consider the matrix: 
1 2 3 4
2 3 4 5
3 4 5 6
The satisfaction value for the building denoted by the end points (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4) is 2 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 36 
But the admin is quite sceptical when constructing buildings and prefers to construct only those building which will provide a satisfaction S which follows the following rule. 
B = S mod A , where A and B are some integers
Now the Admin wants to know, how many such buildings can be made which satisfies the above criterion ?
 
Input
The first line contains four space separated integers N , M, A and  B . Then N lines follow. Each of the next N lines contains M space separated integers. Thus input is a matrix of order  N x M 
Output
Output a single line denoting the number of buildings that will satisfy the criterion mentioned in the problem statement.
Constraints

1 ≤ M ≤ 350
1 ≤ N ≤ 350
1 ≤ A ≤ 100000
0 ≤ B < A
1 ≤ Value of any matrix element ≤ 2500000000

 
Example
Input:
2 2 3 2
2 5    
6 1

Output:
4
 
Explanation
The buildings that will satisfy the constraint are {(1,1)} = 2 mod 3 = 2{(1,2)} = 5 mod 3 = 2 {(1, 1), (2, 1)} = 2 + 6 = 8 mod 3 = 2 and  {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)} = 2 + 5 + 6 + 1 = 14 mod 3 = 2
