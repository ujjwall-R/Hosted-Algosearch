Chef has an integer array X, and a binary array S, both of size N. He wants to know how many vectors (denote by V) of N elements exist, for which the following conditions hold for all valid indices i (that is, for all 1 ≤ i ≤ N).
0 ≤ Vi < 1018
If Si = 1, Vi is ≥ Xi, and if Si = 0, Vi ≤ Xi
Sum of the elements of V, when viewed as a string, contains "47" as a substring.


Please help Chef find this count. Since it may be a very large number, you should output the count modulo 109+7.

Input
The first line of input contains one integer N. The next N lines contain two integers each, with the ith containing Si and Xi. If Si = 0, then Vi ≤ Xi, otherwise Vi ≥ Xi.

Output
Output a single line containing a single integer — the answer to Chef's problem modulo 109+7.

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 8
0 ≤ Xi < 1018
Si is either 0 or 1. 

Example
Input:
2
0 22
0 30

Output:
6


Explanation:

There are 6 such vectors: (17, 30), (18, 29), (19, 28), (20, 27), (21, 26), (22, 25).
