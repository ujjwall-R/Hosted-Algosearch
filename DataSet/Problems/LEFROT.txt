An operation on an array of size nn shifts each of the array's elements 11 unit to the left. For example, if  22 operations are performed on array [1,2,3,4,5], then the array would become [3,4,5,1,2].   
Given an array of n integers and a number, d, perform d operations on the array. Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers. 
Input Format:
The    first   line    contains    two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of n (the number of integers) and d (the number of operations you must perform). 
The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the respective elements of the array's initial state. 
Constraints:

1≤n≤105 
1≤d≤n 
1≤ai≤106 where ai is the ith element of array   

Output Format:
Print a single    line    of n space-separated integers denoting the final state of the array after performing d operations. 
Sample Input:
5 4
1 2 3 4 5   
Sample Output:
5 1 2 3 4
Explanation:
When we perform d=4 operations, the array undergoes the following sequence of changes:   
[1,2,3,4,5]→[2,3,4,5,1]→[3,4,5,1,2]→[4,5,1,2,3]→[5,1,2,3,4] 
Thus, we print the array's final state as a single line of space-separated    values,
which is 5 1 2 3 4.
