Chef's friend Rahul gave him a piece of paper. On this paper there are few strings(string A) and beside each string another string(String B) is given. Chef needs to find whether he can convert string A to string B after zero or more deletions. But there is  a condition chef can delete either the first or the last character. Chef is busy and so he needs your help.  
Input:
t: Number of test cases
sa: String A
sb: String B  
Output:
Print 'YES' if  String A can be converted to String B otherwise print 'NO'  
Constraints:
1<=t<=1000
1<=length(sa),length(sb)<=20  
Sample Input:
2
abcdefgh
cde
hello
hey  
Sample Output:
YES
NO  
Explanation:
In the first test case we can convert "abcdefgh" into "cde" by deleting a,b,f,g and h.
In the second test case we cannot convert "hello" to "hey"
