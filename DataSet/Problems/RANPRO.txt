Given an Array of length  N  containing elements Ai ( i = 1 to n ) . You have to handle Q queries on this array . Each Query is of two types k=(1 or 2). 
Type 1:- k l r in which you have to tell whether the product of numbers in range l to r results in a perfect square or not. if product of numbers in range l tor is a perfect square then simply output YES else output NO.
Type 2:- k i val Multiply the value present at index i with val.
Note#1: 1 based indexing in each query.
Note#2: Values of prime factors of all numbers val and Ai is between 2 to 100 only.
Input:

First line will contain N, denoting the size of the array. Then the next line follow. 
N integers  Ai−An.
Third line will contain Q, denoting the number of queries. Then the next Q lines follow -description of each query. 
Each query consists of either type 1 or type 2 and each query gives you three elements either
-{k l r} or {k i val}

Output:
For each  Query of Type 1 Output either "YES" or "NO" Without Quotes.
Constraints

1≤N≤20000
1≤Q≤20000
2≤Ai≤1000000
1≤i,l,r≤N
1≤val≤1000000
1≤l≤r

Subtasks
Subtask 1 :-40 points 

Values of prime factors of all numbers val and Ai is between 2 to 40 only.

Subtask 2 :- 60 points

Original Constraints 

Sample Input:
4
2 2 3 4
4
1 1 2
1 3 4
2 3 3
1 1 4

Sample Output:
YES
NO
YES

EXPLANATION:
-Query 1 :- product of numbers in range 1 to 2=2 * 2=4 (perfect square so YES)
-Query 2:- product of numbers in range 3 to 4 = 3 * 4 = 12 (not perfect square so NO)
-Query 3:- multiply number at index3 with 3 so number at index 3= 3*3 = 9 .
-Query 4:- product of numbers in range 1 to 4 = 2 * 2 * 9 * 4 = 144 (perfect square so YES)
