Jethalal is traveling from City AA to City BB for his Business meeting. 
And while onboarding the train, he gets a call from his closest friend Mehta and came to know that Mehta was travelling from City CC to City DD.
And they decided to meet each other at the station that is common between their respective train's route.
Imagine the route of the train as a cartesian-co-ordinate system. Your task is to determine whether they can meet or not.

Input:

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 

The 1st line contains coordinates of city A separated by space - AxAx AyAy
The 2nd line contains coordinates of city B separated by space - BxBx ByBy
The 3rd line contains coordinates of city C separated by space - CxCx CyCy
The 4th line contains coordinates of city D separated by space - DxDx DyDy

The source and destination of journey are distinct and does not lie on same route.

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line "YES" if they can meet, otherwise "NO" (without quotes).

Constraints
