NN integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN are placed in a circle in such a way that for each valid ii, Ai and Ai+1 are adjacent, and A1 and AN are also adjacent.
We want to repeat the following operation exactly N−1 times (until only one number remains):

Select two adjacent numbers. Let's denote them by a and b.
Score a+b penalty points.
Erase both a and b from the circle and insert a+b in the space between them.

What is the minimum number of penalty points we can score?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers a1,a2,…,aN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of penalty points.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
2≤N≤400
1≤ai≤109 for each valid i

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (10 points):

2≤N≤10
ai≤10 for each valid i

Subtask #2 (10 points):

2≤N≤25
a1,a2,…,aN are distinct powers of 2 (including 1)

Subtask #3 (10 points): 2≤N≤100
Subtask #4 (70 points): original constraints

Explanation

[10,10,1]→[10,11], penalty:  11
[10,11]→[21], penalty:  21
Total penalty: 11+21=32
