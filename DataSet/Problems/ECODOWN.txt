In these days of Lockdown, Motu's Father bussiness is in Loss. On Zeroth day of Lockdown the loss was Rs P, then Rs Q on the First day. Motu observed loss as a function and wanted to calculate the loss on Nth day of the Lockdown. 
He observed that the loss is dependent on the previous days, i.e.
F(n)=F(n−1)+F(n−2)+F(n−1)∗F(n−2)
You are given the loss on Zeroth day and the First day of Lockdown. You have to find the loss on Nth day.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains a single line of input , having three integers P,Q,N. 

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line answer ,loss on the Nth day. Loss can be large, output it modulo 1000000007 (109+7).
Constraints

1≤T≤105
0≤P,Q,N≤109

Sample Input:
 2
 1 2 3
 2 3 3

Sample Output:
 17
 47

EXPLANATION:
For first test case
 F(0)=1 ,
 F(1)=2 ,
 F(2)=1+2+(1∗2)=5 ,
 F(3)=5+2+(5∗2)=17
