You are given an array AA consisting of NN integers and QQ queries. Each query is described by two integers LL and RR. For each query, output the number of tuples (i,j,k)(i,j,k) such that L≤i<j<k≤RL≤i<j<k≤R and Ai+Aj+Ak is an even number.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers N and Q.
The next line contains N integers A1,…,AN.
Then Q lines follow, each containing two integers Li and Ri.

Output Format
For each query, output the number of tuples possible as mentioned in the problem statement.
Constraints

1≤T≤103
1≤N,Q≤105
0≤Ai≤106
1≤Li≤Ri≤N
The sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106.
The sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 105

Explanation

For the first query, we can choose (1,2,3) since A1+A2+A3=6 is an even 
number.
For the second query, we can choose (2,3,5) since A2+A3+A5=10 is even, and (3,4,5) since A3+A4+A5=12 is even.
