In the cursed land of earth where all crops are failing, Tom Cooper is trying to grow n acres of crop this season, and he can grow one crop in an acre. Tom has two sets of n crop seeds each. In the two sets, the two ith crop seeds are the same type crop.
The first set of n crop seeds are independent and each of them require their own preparation and can be grown independently. The ith crop under this category will take a cost of xi.
The second set of n crops are genetically modified to withstand extreme conditions and even withstand the intense dust storms. But there is one thing: to allot a proper usage of resources, the crops are designed in such a way that the ith crop can be directly grown without fertiliser or other resource if the genetically modified (i−1)th crop is grown: that is, for example, the waste material of the (i−1)th crop can be fertiliser for the ith crop, etc. Thus he can grow the ith crop in them in a constant c cost along with a preparation cost of cki but if he has also grown the (i−1)th genetically modified crop, he can skip the preparation cost and grow the ith crop in just c cost.
Since the world market expects a lot of variety in the crops available, Tom wants to maximize the number of different types of crops he grows. That is for example, Tom can grow only genetically modified crop 1 on all his fields. In that case, he grows 1 crop. Tom wants to maximize this number of crops he grows. Note that growing both genetically modified and normal versions of the same crop count as growing 1 crop only, and not 2.
Thus, Tom wants you to find out the maximum number of different crops he can grow, and the corresponding minimum cost at which he can grow n sets of crops.
Input format

The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
For each test case, the first line contains two numbers n and c.
The second line has n integers x1,x2,…,xn.
The third line has n integers k1,k2,…,kn.

Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤n≤104

Output format
For each test case, output a line having two integers - the maximum number of different crops that can be grown, and the minimum cost that'll be taken for this set of crops.
