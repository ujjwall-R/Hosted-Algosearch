The longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a sequence B1,B2,…,BL is the longest sequence of valid indices i1,i2,…,ik such that i1<i2<…<ik and Bi1<Bi2<…<Bik.
You are given a sequence A1,A2,…,AN. You may modify it by performing the following operation zero or more times:

Let K be the length of the LIS of the current sequence A.
Choose a position in this sequence (possibly the beginning or end of the sequence) and insert a new element K into this sequence at this position.
This way, the sequence A changes and the next operation is performed on this changed sequence.

For example, if A=[3,3,4], then the LIS of A has length 2, so we can insert 2 anywhere into A, obtaining one of the sequences [2,3,3,4], [3,2,3,4], [3,3,2,4] or [3,3,4,2].
Find the maximum length of the LIS of A that can be obtained after performing the given operation a finite number of times.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum possible length of the LIS.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤N≤106
1≤Ai≤109 for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106

Explanation
Example case 1: We can perform the following operations (the newly inserted elements, which are always equal to the length of the LIS of the previous sequence, are underlined): [5,4,3,2,1]→[1_,5,4,3,2,1]→[1,2_,5,4,3,2,1]→[1,2,3_,5,4,3,2,1]→[1,2,3,4_,5,4,3,2,1].
