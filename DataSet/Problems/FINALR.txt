Carthikeya, Parkas and Baccha have reached the final round of Sarma Templeton internship procedure. The final round is a live coding round. The interviewer on the advise of respect Director Mr. Sarma decides to ask a simple question first to test his coding speed. The question is to print a checkerboard of dimensions mm rows and nn columns using ‘.’ which denotes white and ‘*’ which denotes black squares. The top-left corner has to be black in color. To make things difficult, the input will be in a weird format. Help them so that they don’t have to go to E. D. Saw for internship.
Input:
Input is given as ‘[ nn,m ]’ or ‘( n , m )’ (without the quotes)  but with any number of whitespaces between any two of these units which form the input. Examples of valid inputs are ‘[         17,    12]’ and  ‘(152,22)’. Examples of invalid inputs are ‘[1,5)’ and ‘(1 3, 132)’. 
Output:
Print the checkerboard pattern using ‘.’ and ‘*’ using given dimensions.
