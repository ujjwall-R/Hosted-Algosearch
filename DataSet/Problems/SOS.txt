Roughly speaking, this problem asks you to create the checker of the problem used in December CookOff.
You are given a tree with N vertices and a string C of length N, consisting of the characters 'R', 'G' and 'B'.
For each integer i (1≤i≤N), Ci is the color of vertex i — 'R' is for Red, 'G' is for Green and 'B' is for Blue.
The input is called valid if for all pairs of Blue vertices (u, v), u≠v, there is at least one Red vertex and one Green vertex on the simple path between u and v.
Your task is to validate the input for given T test cases. For each test case, print Yes if the input is valid, otherwise No.
Input Format

The first line of input contains one positive integer T, the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains one positive integer N, the number of vertices of the tree.
The second line of each test case contains a string C, denoting the colors of the vertices.
Each of the following N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v, denoting an edge between vertices u and v in the tree.

Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing Yes if the input is valid, and No otherwise.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).
Constraints

1≤T≤104
1≤N≤2⋅105
The sum of N for each test case is at most 2⋅105
|C|=N
C consists of three types of characters, 'R', 'G' and 'B'
1≤u,v≤N,u≠v
The input graph forms a tree

Explanation

Test case 1:
The only pair is (1,4).
Test case 3:
There are no pairs.
