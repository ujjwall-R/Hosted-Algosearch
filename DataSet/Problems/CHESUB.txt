You are given two integers N and K, and an array A of N integers. You have to choose K disjoint non-empty subarrays such that the score is maximized. 
The score is calculated as follows:
Score=K∑i=1Sum[i]⋅i,
where Sum[i] denotes sum of elements of i-th subarray. By the i-th subarray, we mean the i-th one in the order from left to right.
Find the maximum score that can be achieved.
Note: The subarrays are not required to cover the whole array. It is allowed for some elements of A to belong to none of the subarrays.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum score.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤105
1≤K≤min(100,N)
−106≤Ai≤106
The sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105

Explanation

Test Case 1: One way to choose 2 disjoint non-empty subarrays is:

S1=[1,2] and S2=[3,1]
The score is 3⋅1+4⋅2=11, which is the maximum possible. 

Test Case 2: One way to choose 2 disjoint non-empty subarrays is:

S1=[2,11] and S2=[12]
The score is 13⋅1+12⋅2=37, which is the maximum possible.
