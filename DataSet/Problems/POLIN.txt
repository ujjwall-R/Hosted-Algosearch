Given NN points of the form (xi,yi)(xi,yi) on a 22-D plane.
From each point, you draw 22 lines one horizontal and one vertical. Now some of the lines may overlap each other, therefore you are required to print the number of distinct lines you can see on the plane.
Note:

Two horizontal lines are distinct if they pass through different yy coordinates.
Two vertical lines are distinct if they pass through different xx coordinates.

Input Format

First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains a single integer NN, the number of points.
The next NN lines contain two space separated integers xi,yixi,yi, the coordinate of the ithith point.

Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line the number of distinct lines that can be seen on the plane.
Constraints

1≤T≤10001≤T≤1000
1≤N≤1051≤N≤105
0≤Xi,Yi≤1090≤Xi,Yi≤109
Sum of NN over all test cases is atmost 105.

Explanation
Test Case 1: There are 2 horizontal lines passing through Y=0 and Y=1, and 2  vertical lines passing through X=0 and X=1.

Test Case 2: There are 5 horizontal lines passing through Y=0,Y=1,Y=2,Y=3 and Y=4 and 1 vertical line passing through X=0.
Test Case 3: There is 1 horizontal line passing through Y=10 and 1 vertical line passing through X=10.
