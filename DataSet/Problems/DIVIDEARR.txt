Given a sequence XX of length MM, f(X)f(X) is defined as f(X)=∑M−1i=1|Xi+1−Xi|. 
Specifically, if M=1, then f(X)=0.
For e.g., f([3,1,7,2])=|1−3|+|7−1|+|2−7|=13
JJ has an array A of length N. He wants to divide the array A into two subsequences P and Q (possibly empty) such that the value of f(P)+f(Q) is as large as possible. (Note that each Ai must belong to either subsequence P or subsequence Q).
Help him find this maximum value of f(P)+f(Q).
Note: A sequence X is a subsequence of a sequence Y if X can be obtained from Y by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
Input Format

The first line contains T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the size of the array A.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN denoting the array A.

Output Format
Output the largest value of f(P)+f(Q).
Constraints

1≤T≤200
1≤N≤1000
1≤Ai≤105
It is guaranteed that the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 3000.

Explanation
Test case-1: One way to divide the array into two subsequences P and Q as follows: 
P=[1,6,2], Q=[4,3,4]. 
f(P)=|6−1|+|2−6|=9 and f(Q)=|3−4|+|4−3|=2. 
Therefore f(P)+f(Q)=11. 
It can be proven that this is the maximum value of f(P)+f(Q).
Test case-2: One way to divide the array into two subsequences P and Q as follows: 
P=[1,4], Q=[2,3,5]. 
f(P)=|4−1|=3 and f(Q)=|3−2|+|5−3|=3. 
Therefore f(P)+f(Q)=6. 
It can be proven that this is the maximum value of f(P)+f(Q).
Test case-3: One way to divide the array into two subsequences P and Q as follows: 
P=[1,10], Q=[]. 
f(P)=|10−1|=9 and f(Q)=0. 
Therefore f(P)+f(Q)=9. 
It can be proven that this is the maximum value of f(P)+f(Q).
