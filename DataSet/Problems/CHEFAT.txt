A food fair is being organised in Chef's town. N booths were set up in a straight line and numbered 1 through N. For each i (1≤i≤N), the probability with which the food served at booth i will cause food poisoning at the beginning of the day is Pi.
Over the course of the day, the Chef observes that certain booths might decide to offer less unhealthy food based on feedback from customers. You should process Q queries of the following two types:

0LR — Compute the probability that eating at each booth between booths L and R (inclusive) does not cause food poisoning.
1LRT — Each booth between booths L and R (inclusive) starts offering food that is T times more likely to cause food poisoning.

Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The second line contains N space-separated decimal numbers P1,P2,P3,…,PN.
Each of the following Q lines describes one query in the format 0LR or 1LRT. Here, L and R are integers and T is a decimal number.

Output
For each query of type 0, print a single line containing one real number — the probability of not getting food poisoning. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute error doesn't exceed 10−6.
Constraints

1≤N,Q≤105
0≤Pi≤0.9 for each valid i
1≤L≤R≤N
0≤T<1
all decimals on the input will be given with at most 6 fractional digits

Subtasks
Subtask 1 (15 points): 1≤N,Q≤2,000
Subtask 2 (85 points): original constraints
Example Input

4 7
0.1 0.25 0.85 0.43
0 1 3
1 2 4 0.73
1 1 3 0.00255
1 3 4 0.01258
0 1 4
0 2 3
0 3 3

Example Output

0.10125000
0.99531391
0.99951473
0.99998009

Explanation
The answer to the first query is (1−0.1)⋅(1−0.25)⋅(1−0.85)=0.10125.
After the second query, the probabilities of getting food poisoning at each booth become [0.1,0.1825,0.6205,0.3139].
