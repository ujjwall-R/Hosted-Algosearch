 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese .
 
In this problem you will have to implement a simple editor. The editor maintains the content of a string S and have two following functions:

"+ i x": insert a string x into the current string S after the i'th character of the S (we use 1-indexing in this problem). When i equals to 0 it mean we add x at the beginning of S.
"? i len": Print the sub-string of length len starting at position i'th of S.

At the beginning, the editor holds an empty string. There will be Q queries of the two types described above.






 
Input
The first line contains the integer Q.
Each line in the next Q lines contains one query.

 
Output
For each query of the second type, print out the answer sub-string in one line.

 
Constraints

For the first type of query: 0 ≤ i ≤ |S|
For the second type of query: 1 ≤ i ≤ |S| - len + 1 


20 points

Q ≤ 1000, |S| ≤ 1000, sum of value of all lens ≤ 1000: 


30 points

Q ≤ 10000, |S| ≤ 10000, sum of value of all lens ≤ 10000: 


50 points

Q ≤ 3×105, |S| ≤ 3×105, sum of value of all lens ≤ 3×105: 


Example
Input:
5
+ 0 ab
+ 1 c
? 1 3
+ 2 dd
? 1 5

Output:
acb
acddb

 
Explanation

"+ 0 ab": S = "ab"
"+ 1 c": S = "acb"
"+ 2 dd": S = "acddb"
