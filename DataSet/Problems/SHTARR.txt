You have an array A of length N consisting of positive integers. Let's consider N vertical segments (parallel to y axis) on the plane, the i-th segment connects the points (i, 0) and (i, Ai).
You have  Q  queries of following two types:

+ i X  :  Ai += X  
? i L R : Let's consider R - L+ 1 rays which are parallel to x axis. The j-th ray eminates at point (i - 0.5, L+ j - 1.5) and extends to the right infinitely long parallel to x axis. You have to print the number of the segments that will be shot by some ray. If a ray shoots a segment then it stops at that point and does't extend further. 


Note that all the queries of the second type are independent of each other.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer   T  denoting the number of tests 
The first line of each test case consists of two space separated integers  N, Q .
The second line contains N space separated denoting the array A.
Next  Q  lines contain the description of the queries in the format above.
Output
After each query of the second type, output in a single line the number of segments that are shot.
Constraints

 1 ≤   T  ≤  100  
  1   ≤ N ≤  106 
  1   ≤ Q ≤  105  
  0 <  X  ≤ 10,000  
  1   ≤ i   ≤  N  
  1   ≤  Ai  ≤  109  
  1   ≤  L ≤ R   ≤  109  
 The sum of N over all testcases does not exceed 106 
 The sum of Q over all testcases does not exceed 105 

Subtasks

Subtask #1 (10 points) : There are only queries of the second type
Subtask #2 (10 points) : In all queries of the second type i = 1  
Subtask #3 (30 points) :  The sum of Q over all testcases does not exceed 104
Subtask #4 (50 points) :  Original constraints
