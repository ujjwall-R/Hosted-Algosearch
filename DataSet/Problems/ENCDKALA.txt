Problem:

MR Kalakeya is the king of the Kalakeya kingdom. It's the 21st century where robots are the soldiers.
There is a boss for all robots named CHITTICHITTI . another kingdom contains only human soldiers. This is an advantage for him. 
 Whenever he wants to control his soldiers he instructs CHITTI which will encode the message and share it with all other robots securely. So that other kingdom soldiers can't understand communication between them. Kalakeya  programmed CHITTI to encode a statement SS as follows:
1.Any space should be replaced by &&
2.If the alphabet is not A/B/C/D/E then they should appear at the end in reverse order. For example, BESTFRIENDBESTFRIEND will become  BEEDNIRFTS. 
As Kalakeya did a great job and won the war you're asked to code in the same way to make one more encoding robot.

INPUT:

First-line contains the number of statements(T).

Next T lines contain a sentence(S) to encode. 


OUTPUT:

For each S print its encoded string in a single line.

Constraints:


0<T<11

0<S<101
Sample Input:



1

Sample Output:
