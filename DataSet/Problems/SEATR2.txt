Sereja has a rooted tree of N nodes with node 1 being the root node. He wants to find the number of ways of assigning an integer in the range [1, M] to each node, such that value of each node should be a multiple of it's parent node's value (for vertex #1 there is no parent so any number fit condition). As the answer could be large, report it modulo (109 + 7).

Input
The first line of input contains an integer T — the number of test cases. T tests follow.
First line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M. Each of the next N-1 lines contains two integers (u, v) — a pair of vertices connected by an edge. 

Output
For each test case, output a single integer corresponding to the answer in separate line.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 500
1 ≤ M ≤ 20000
1 ≤ u, v ≤ N
It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree (i.e., there won't be any cycles or self-loops).

Explanation
                    In first test case there are five possible assigns of numbers: [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [1, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2]. 
In second test case there are hundred possible assigns: [1], [2], [3], ..., [100].
