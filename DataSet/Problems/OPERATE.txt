Given KK arrays of length NN where the elements are bounded in the range [L,R].
The Function value of an array is defined as the sum of all elements present in it.
In one move you can change at most 1 element from all the arrays and the changed value must lie within the range [L,R]. 
What is the minimum number of operations required to make the function value of all arrays equal?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers K, N, L, R.
Next K lines contains an array of length N.

Output
For each test case, print the minimum number of operations needed to make the function value of all arrays equal in a new line.
Constraints

1≤T≤5
1≤K≤105
1≤N≤105
1≤N∗K≤105
1≤L≤R≤109

Example Input
1
4 3 1 9
1 1 2
1 2 3
1 2 4
1 2 2

Example Output
1

Explanation

Change array 1 to [1,3,2]
No change in array 2 
Change array 3 to [1,2,3]
Change array 4 to [1,2,3]
Sum of all arrays is equal.
