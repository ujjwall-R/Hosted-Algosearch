A permutation of length NN is an array of NN integers such that every integer between 11 and N (inclusive) appears in it exactly once.
Chef creates a set from a permutation (P1,P2,…,PN) of length N, as follows:

Initially Chef takes a empty set S=ϕ, and then for every index i(1≤i≤N), Chef insert a pair of integers (li,ri) into S, where 1≤li≤ri≤N and (Pli,Pli+1,…,Pri) denotes the longest subsegment of the permutation with Pi as the maximum element. 

Note: 

The elements of the set S are always distinct.
Two pairs (li,ri) and (lj,rj) are same only if li=lj and ri=rj.

For example, if the permutation is (2,3,4,1), Chef creates the following set S={(1,1),(1,2),(1,4),(4,4)}.
You are given a set T containing N distinct pairs of integers. Find the number of different permutations of length N from which Chef can create a set S, which is equivalent to set T. Since the number can be very large, print it modulo (109+7). 
Two sets S and T are considered equivalent if:

∣S∣=∣T∣, where ∣S∣ denotes the size of set S.
Every element of S is present in T, i.e, for each (li,ri)∈S,(li,ri)∈T.

Note that the elements of the set T may not be given in a particular order.
Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow:
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, denoting the size of set T.
Each of the next N lines contains a pair of integers (li,ri), denoting the set T.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line the number of valid permutations, modulo (109+7). 
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤N≤2⋅105
1≤li≤ri≤N for each valid i
(li,ri)≠(lj,rj) if i≠j
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

Explanation
Test case 1: There are two permutations of length 2. [1,2] generates the set S={(1,1),(1,2)} which is not equivalent to T={(2,2),(1,2)} and [2,1] generates the set S={(1,2),(2,2)}, which is equivalent to T={(2,2),(1,2)}.
Test case 2: There is no permutation of length 3 which can generate a set equivalent to T={(3,3),(1,3),(2,2)}.
Test case 3: Some of the valid permutations are:  [2,4,5,3,1], [1,4,5,3,2], [1,2,5,4,3] etc. However [1,2,3,4,5] is not a valid permutation since it generates the set S={(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5)} which is not equivalent to set T.
