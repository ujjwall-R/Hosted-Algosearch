Appy loves balloons! She wants you to give her balloons on each of NN consecutive days (numbered 11 through N); let's denote the number of balloons Appy wants on day i by Ai. The problem is that you only have M balloons. Fortunately, you can give her candies instead of balloons as well. On each day i, Appy accepts Bi candies per each balloon you do not give her — formally, if you give Appy Xi balloons on day i, then you have to give her Ci=max(0,Ai−Xi)⋅Bi candies as well.
Your task is to minimize the maximum number of candies you give Appy on some day — find the minimum possible value of max(C1,C2,C3,...,CN).
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and M.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
The third line contains N space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BN.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the minimum value of max(C1,C2,C3,...,CN).

Explanation
If you give Appy 0,0,0,1,2 balloons on days 1 through 5, then the required numbers of candies on each day are 1,4,9,12,15. The maximum number of candies is 15, required on day 5.
