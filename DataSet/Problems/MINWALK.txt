Consider a weighted, undirected and connected graph with N nodes, numbered 1 to N, and M edges. Find the minimum cost of any walk from node S to node T , via node V (visiting node V is compulsory) , where cost of a walk is the sum of weights of distinct edges occurring in the walk. This means that even if an edge occurs multiple times in a walk, its weight is added only once to the cost of the walk.
Warning: Large input data, use faster methods for Input.

Input


The first line contains an integer t , the number of test cases.
t test cases follow:
The first line of each test case contains 2 space seperated integers: N and M.
The next line contains 3 space seperated integers: S, T and V.
The next M lines contain 3 space seperated integers each: a b c , denoting an edge between nodes a and b with weight c.
Note: There is at most one edge between any pair of nodes and there are no self loops.


Output

Output the required answer for each test case on a separate line

Constraints

1 ≤ t ≤ 5
1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
1 ≤ S,T,V ≤ N
N-1 ≤ M ≤ min(100000,N*(N-1)/2)
1 ≤ a, b ≤ N
1 ≤ c ≤ 109

Example
Input:
2
4 3
1 3 4
1 2 1
2 3 2
2 4 3
4 3
1 1 4
1 2 1
2 3 2
2 4 3

Output:
6
4

Explanation:

Test case 1:
The walk with least cost is: 1->2->3->2->4
Note that the edge (2-3) occurs twice in the walk, but its weight is added only once to the walk.
