You have nn Jenga blocks, with values written on them from 11 to nn. There will be exactly 11 block, with value = ii (ii belongs to range [1,n]).
You organised the Jenga Blocks in the form of a stack, in increasing order of their values, with the top-most block having value equal to 11 and the bottom-most block having value equal to nn.
Your one friend is gonna play with you. In every turn of this Modified Jenga Game, your friend will select a unique block with value equal to xx, and your friend will note down the number of blocks placed above the block, with value xx, after that, you will remove that block from the stack in such a way that the stack remains intact and will put it on the top. 
You will play this game for qq turns. 
Unfortunately, your friend lost the notes, he was noting down.
But, since you know the value of xx, for each of the qq turns, please make the notes again to help him.
Input:

First line will contain nn, the number of Jenga Blocks you have.
Second line will an integer qq, the number of turns.
Next qq lines will contain an integer xx, which was selected by your friend in each turn.

Output:
Output the notes of your friend, in the form of qq space-seperated integers each denoting the number of blocks above the block numbered xx, before its moved by you.
