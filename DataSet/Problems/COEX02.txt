Chef while sitting at a coffee shop sees a girl making horizontal and vertical lines on a rectangular sheet of paper and then doing some counting. Chef being a maths freak, gathers courage and walks up to the girl to inquire what she is upto. The girl tells Chef that she has been given an arduous task of making M and N number of horizontal and vertical lines respectively on the sheet of paper and find the total number of quadrilaterals formed by it. Chef being from engineering background, knew a shortcut to solve this. So he tries to impress the girl, by telling her that he will make her task easy. All she has to do is to tell him the number of horizontal and vertical lines and Chef will tell her the number of quadrilaterals formed. 
If the Chef succeeds, the girl would go on a date with him.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contains two space separated integers M and N, where M is the number of horizontal lines and N is the number of vertical lines.

Output
For each test case output the number of quadilaterals.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ M,N ≤ 10^9

Example
Input:
2
4 4
5 6
Output:
36
150
