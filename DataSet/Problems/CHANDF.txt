Chef got interested in bits and wanted to learn about them, so his friend Pintu gave him a special function F(X,Y,Z)=(X∧Z)⋅(Y∧Z)F(X,Y,Z)=(X∧Z)⋅(Y∧Z), where ∧∧ is the bitwise AND operator and X,Y,ZX,Y,Z are non-negative integers.
Pintu wants Chef to maximise the function F(X,Y,Z) for given X and Y by choosing an appropriate Z. However, to make it interesting, Pintu also gave Chef limits L and R for Z. In other words, he wants Chef to find a non-negative integer Z (L≤Z≤R) such that F(X,Y,Z)=maxL≤k≤R(F(X,Y,k)). If there is more than one such value of Z, he should find the smallest one in the range [L,R].
Since Chef is busy cooking in the kitchen, he needs you to help him solve this problem.
Note: X, Y, L and R are chosen in such a way that maxL≤k≤R(F(X,Y,k)) never exceeds 262.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers X, Y, L and R.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest value of Z in the given range that maximises F.

15
7


Explanation
Example case 1: Here, Z=15 maximises the function, since F(7,12,15)=84. It is impossible to reach F>84 with any Z in the given range.
Example case 2: The smallest Z which maximises F is Z=7, and the value of F for this Z is 28.
