Edward Elric is chasing after Scar. To stop Edward, Scar creates NN barriers in the way, numbered from 11 to NN. 
Each barrier Scar created is either one of the following two types.

Type 1 barrier - This barrier starts from a height XX above the ground and extends till the sky.
Type 2 barrier - This barrier starts from the ground and extends up to height XX above the ground.


The height of Edward is HH units and he has an alchemic life force of LL units. Moreover, he can duck by Y1Y1 units and jump by height Y2Y2 units (as explained in the figures). He starts crossing barriers in sequence, starting from barrier 11 till the barrier NN. Whenever he can't pass a barrier by ducking or jumping (considered passed even when the barrier just touches him), he uses Alchemy to break the barrier. However, this costs him a single unit of his alchemic life force.
If after breaking a barrier no life force is left, Edward gets completely exhausted, unable to pass that barrier.
How many barriers can Edward cross?   
And remember never to call him a pipsqueak if his height is too short!
Input:

The first line contains TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
For each test case, the first line contains five integers NN, HH, Y1Y1, Y2Y2 and LL.
The i-th of the next NN lines contains two integers titi and XiXi for the ithith barrier where ti=1ti=1 denotes a Type 1 Barrier and ti=2ti=2 denotes a Type 2 barrier.

Output:
For each test case print a single line containing the number of barriers Edward can pass.

Explanation
Test Case 1: 
Given N=6, H=5, Y1=1, Y2=2 and L=3.
He passes the first three barriers by either ducking or jumping. He uses alchemic life force for breaking 4th, 5th and 6th barriers because he cannot pass them by either jumping or ducking. He gets exhausted after breaking the 6th barrier and is unable to pass it. So, in total he passes 5 barriers.
