There are NN cars (numbered 11 through NN) on a circular track with length NN. For each ii (2≤i≤N2≤i≤N), the ii-th of them is at a distance i−1i−1 clockwise from car 11, i.e. car 11 needs to travel a distance i−1i−1 clockwise to reach car ii. Also, for each valid ii, the ii-th car has fifi litres of gasoline in it initially.
You are driving car 11 in the clockwise direction. To move one unit of distance in this direction, you need to spend 11 litre of gasoline. When you pass another car (even if you'd run out of gasoline exactly at that point), you steal all its gasoline. Once you do not have any gasoline left, you stop.
What is the total clockwise distance travelled by your car? 
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers f1,f2,…,fNf1,f2,…,fN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the total clockwise distance travelled.

Explanation
Test case 1: The car starts with 3 liters of gasoline. Using this, the car can travel 3 units. On its journey, there is no other car having gasoline. Thus, the car stops after 3 units.
Test case 2: The car starts with 1 liter of gasoline.

After traveling 1 unit, it passes another car with 1 liter gasoline. Thus, the amount of gasoline left after traveling 1 unit is 1 liter. 
After traveling 2 units, it passes another car with 1 liter gasoline. Thus, the amount of gasoline left after traveling 2 units is 1 liter.
After traveling 3 units, it passes another car with 1 liter gasoline. Thus, the amount of gasoline left after traveling 3 units is 1 liter.
After traveling 4 units, it passes another car with 1 liter gasoline. Thus, the amount of gasoline left after traveling 4 units is 1 liter.
After traveling 5 units, there is no car with gasoline. Thus, the car stops after 5 units.

Test case 3: The car starts with 5 liters of gasoline.

After traveling 1 unit, it passes another car with 4 liters gasoline. Thus, the amount of gasoline left after traveling 1 unit is 5−1+4=8 liters. 
After traveling 2 units, it passes another car with 3 liters gasoline. Thus, the amount of gasoline left after traveling 2 units is 8−1+3=10 liters.
After traveling 3 units, it passes another car with 2 liters gasoline. Thus, the amount of gasoline left after traveling 3 units is 10−1+2=11 liters.
After traveling 4 units, it passes another car with 1 liter gasoline. Thus, the amount of gasoline left after traveling 4 units is 11−1+1=11 liters.
After traveling 5 units, there is no car with gasoline. Thus, after 5 units, 10 liters of gasoline is left. 

The car can move 10 more units using the leftover gasoline. The total distance travelled is 15 units.
