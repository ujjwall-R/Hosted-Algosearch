Chef has a sequence AA of NN integers such that |Ai|≤1.
For each x such that −N≤x≤N, find the number of non-empty subsequences of A whose sum of elements is x. Since that answer may be too large, print this modulo 163,577,857.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output:
Output 2N+1 space-separated integers C0,C1…C2∗N, where Ci denotes the number of non-empty subsequences with sum (i−N), modulo 163,577,857.
Constraints:

1≤T≤105
1≤N≤105
|Ai|≤1 for each valid i
It's guaranteed that the total length of the arrays in one test file doesn't exceed 2∗106

Sample Input:
2
2
1 0
3
-1 1 -1

Sample Output:
0 0 1 2 0
0 1 3 2 1 0 0

Explanation:
In the first test case, the non-empty subsequences with sum 0 are {0} while the subsequences with sum 1 are {1} and {1,0}.
