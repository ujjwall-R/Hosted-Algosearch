You are given an array a of length N and Q queries. Each query is described by a pair of integers, l and r. Answer each query with the following: if we take every subsequence of the elements with indices between l and r (inclusive) and write down their products, what will be the smallest missing positive integer?
A subsequence of an array is a sequence you obtain by deleting some (possibly zero or all) elements of the array. The product of the empty subsequence is defined to be 1.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The second line contains N space-separated integers a1,a2,…,aN.
Each of the next Q lines contains two space-separated integers, l and r, denoting the query's range.

Output
For each query, output the smallest missing subsequence product on a new line.
Constraints

1≤T≤5
1≤N,Q≤105
1≤ai≤109 for each valid i
1≤l≤r≤N

Explanation
The array is [2,3,2,5,4].
The first query asks about the range [2,3]. The subsequences of this range are [], [3], [2], and [3,2]. They have products 1, 3, 2, and 6, respectively. The smallest missing positive integer from the list of products is 4.
The second query asks about the range [1,4].

[] has product 1
[2] has product 2
[3] has product 3
[2,2] has product 4
[5] has product 5
[2,3] has product 6
But 7 does not appear as a subsequence product in the given range.

The third query asks about the range [3,5].

[] has product 1
[2] has product 2
But 3 does not appear as a subsequence product in the given range.
