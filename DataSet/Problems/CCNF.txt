Chef Ada constructed a simple undirected graph GG with N vertices (numbered 1 through N) as follows:

Start with a complete graph with K vertices and K⋅(K−1)/2 edges.
Then, add N−K vertices one by one. After adding each vetex, find some clique of K−1 vertices in the graph and connect the new vertex to all the vertices of that clique.

Consider N boolean variables X1,X2,…,XN and their negations ¬X1,¬X2,…,¬XN, corresponding to vertices of the graph. You are given the initial values of all variables.
A CNF boolean expression is defined as a conjunction of clauses, where each clause is a disjunction of two or more elements of the set of variables and their negations.
Using the graph G, Ada wrote a CNF boolean expression B with M clauses, where each clause corresponds to a clique in the graph with some (maybe none) of the variables (corresponding to vertices) negated. More formally, for each i from 1 to M:

Ada chose some clique in the graph, consisting of Li vertices Z1,Z2,…,ZLi
then for each valid j, Ada chose a variable Pi,j as either XZj or ¬XZj
the i-th clause in the expression B had Li terms: Pi,1∨Pi,2∨…∨Pi,Li

Ada wants the expression to evaluate to "true". In order to achieve that, she may change the values of variables; for each valid i, the cost of changing the value of Xi (from "true" to "false" or vice versa) is Ci. Find the minimum total cost needed to make the expression B evaluate to "true" or determine that it is impossible.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M and K.
The second line contains a single binary string S with length N describing the initial values of the variables. For each valid i, the i-th character of S is '1' if Xi is true or '0' if Xi is false.
The third line contains N space-separated integers C1,C2,…,CN.
M lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains an integer Li followed by a space and Li space-separated integers representing the variables Pi,1,…,Pi,Li. For each valid i, the variable Xi is represented by the integer i and its negation is represented by −i.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum cost needed to make the boolean expression evaluate to "true", or −1 if it is impossible.

Explanation
Example case 1: The following figure depicts the graph used to generate the expression.

The boolean expression is B=(X1∨¬X2∨X4)∧(X2∨X3∨¬X5)∧(X1∨¬X3∨X2).
One optimal solution is to change the values of X1 and X3.
