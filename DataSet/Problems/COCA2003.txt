Shaun was given NN pairs of parenthesis ( )  by his teacher who gave him a difficult task.The task consists of two steps. First,Shaun should colour all NN pairs of parenthesis each with different color but opening and closing bracket of a particular pair should be of same colour. Then,Shaun should report to his teacher the number of ways he can arrange all 2∗N2∗N brackets such that sequence form is valid. Teacher defined valid sequence by these rules:

Any left parenthesis '(' must have a corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
Any right parenthesis ')' must have a corresponding left parenthesis '('.
Left parenthesis '(' must go before the corresponding right parenthesis ')'. 

Note: Shaun could match opening and closing brackets of different colours. 
Since number of ways can be large, Shaun would report the answer as modulo 1000000007 (109+7).
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, one integer N. 

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line answer given by Shaun to his teacher modulo 1000000007.
Constraints

1≤T≤100000
1≤N≤100000

Sample Input:
   3
   1
   2
   3

Sample Output:
   1
   6
   90

EXPLANATION:
Here numbers from 1 to N have been used to denote parenthesis.A unique number corresponds to a unique pair of parenthesis.
-In the first test case , you can use only one color to color the parenthesis  you could arrange it only in one way i.e, 1 1
-In the second test case  you can use two colors and the possible ways of arranging it are
1 1 2 2
1 2 2 1
1 2 1 2
2 2 1 1
2 1 1 2
2 1 2 1
