A polygon TT is said to be inside a polygon SS if all points that lie strictly inside TT (not on the perimeter of T) also lie strictly inside S.
A multiset of polygons {Q1,Q2,…,Qr} is said to form a chain if there is a permutation p1,p2,…,pr of the integers 1 through r such that for each i (1≤i<r), Qpi is inside Qpi+1.
You are given N convex polygons P1,P2,…,PN in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system. Every 10−100 seconds, you may choose one of the polygons and translate it by upto 10−100 either along the x-axis or along the y-axis.
Find the minimum amount of time necessary to make all N polygons form a chain or decide that it is impossible.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N. The descriptions of N polygons follow.
For each polygon:
The first line contains a single integer M denoting the number of its vertices.
The following M lines describe the vertices in counterclockwise order. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers x and y denoting the coordinates of one vertex.

Output
If it is impossible to make the polygons form a chain, print a single line containing the integer −1.
Otherwise, print a single line containing one real number ― the minimum amount of time. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10−6.
Constraints

2≤N≤20
the sum of M over all polygons does not exceed 100
|x|,|y|≤100

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (10 points): N=2 and both polygons are axis-aligned rectangles
Subtask #2 (20 points): N=2
Subtask #3 (20 points): all polygons are axis-aligned rectangles
Subtask #4 (50 points): original constraints
Example Input

0 0
2 0

0 2

Example Output
3

Explanation
Example case 1: Both P1 and P2 are squares. If we move P2 by 1 unit in the x-direction and by 2 units in the y-direction, the vertices of P1 become the midpoints of edges of P2.
