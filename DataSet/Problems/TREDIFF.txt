You are given a tree with NN nodes (numbered 11 through N). For each valid i, node i has a value Ai.
You should answer Q queries. In each query:

You are given two nodes a and b.
Let S denote the set of all nodes on the simple path between the nodes a and b (including these nodes).
Find the minimum value of |Ax−Ay| over all pairs x,y∈S such that x≠y.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
Each of the next N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting that nodes u and v are connected by an edge.
Each of the last Q lines contains two space-separated integers a and b describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer ― the answer to the query.

Explanation
Example case 1:

For the first query, S={5,6}, so the answer is |A5−A6|=1.
For the second query, S={3,2,1,5} and we can see that |A3−A5|=0.
For the third query, S={1,2,4}.
