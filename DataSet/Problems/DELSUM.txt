 
 You have a list of N numbers. You are deleting D numbers from the list. Print the minimum sum that can be obtained by adding the remaining numbers after deleting exactly D numbers from the list. 
Input
 The first line will contain an integer T representing the number of test cases. Each test case will begin with two space separated numbers, N and D, on a new line.  Next line of each test case of each test case will have N space separated integers, representing the list of numbers.
Output
 Print T lines of numbers representing the minimum sum in each case. 
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 20
1 ≤ D ≤ N

 
Example
Input:
2
5 3
1 1 1 1 1
2 1
3 4
Output:
2
3
 
Explanation
Example case 1. After removing 3 numbers we will be left with sum of 2.
Example case 2. After removing 1 numbers we will be left with sum of 3, the only number left
