You are given a sequence of integers a1,a2,…,an. You should answer m queries on this sequence.
Each query is described by two indices l and r. The answer to a query can be computed as follows:

for each element of the subsequence al,al+1,…ar, compute its number of occurrences in this subsequence
create a new set occ containing each number of occurrences computed in the previous step
the answer is the minimum excluded element of the set occ, i.e. the smallest positive integer which does not appear in the set occ

Your task is to calculate the answers to all queries. Note that the input is encoded so that you have to answer the queries online — you only know each query (except the first one) after answering all previous queries.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m.
The second line contains n space-separated integers a1,a2,…,an.
The following m lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers x and y. Let a be the answer to the previous query (or a=0 for the first query); the parameters l and r of the current query can be computed as l=x⊕a and r=y⊕a.

Note that  x⊕y denotes bitwise XOR operation.
Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the answer to the query.
Constraints

1≤n,m≤105
1≤ai≤109 for each valid i
0≤x,y<2n
1≤l≤r≤n, where l=x⊕prevAns,r=y⊕prevAns

2


Explanation
In the first query, l=1 and r=10. The elements 4 and 5 have the number of occurrences equal to 1, the element 2 has number of occurrences 2 and the elements 1 and 3 have numbers of occurrences 3, so the answer — the minimum excluded element — is 4.
In the second query, l=1 and r=5, so occ contains only integers 1 and 2 and the answer is 3.
In the third query, l=8 and r=10, all elements of a8,a9,a10 are unique, so the answer is 2.
