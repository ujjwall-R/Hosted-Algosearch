Rick has set out on a space journey to destroy asteroids. He has identified N different groups (numbered from 1 to N) of Asteroids. The size of groups G1, G2, …., Gn are given.
Using his superpowers, he can destroy exactly 1 asteroid from K different groups in 1 minute. He doesn't want to waste his superpower so he will stop once there are less than K groups available.
You want to watch him destroy these asteroids for as long as possible. Can you find the maximum number of minutes you can keep him busy?
Input:

First line will contain N and K, number of groups and number of different groups he can destroy at once. 
Second line contains N integers (G1, G2, ….,Gn) denoting each group's size.

Output:
Print one integer denoting the number of minutes he will take to complete the given task.
Constraints

1≤N≤106
1≤K≤N
1≤Ai≤109

Sample Input:
2 2
2 3

Sample Output:
2

EXPLANATION:
After one minute,  asteroid groups will look like [1,2]
After two minutes,  asteroid groups will look like [0,1]
He will stop after two minutes since there are less than 2 groups which have an asteroid.
