Chef got another sequence as a birthday present. He does not like this sequence very much because it is not sorted. Since you are a good programmer, Chef is asking for your help.
You are given a sequence A1,A2,…,AN and an integer K. You may perform any number of operations of the following type (in any order): choose a valid integer i and swap Ai with Ai+K. Can you sort the sequence this way?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "yes" if the sequence can be sorted or "no" otherwise (without quotes).
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤K≤N≤105
1≤Ai≤109 for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (50 points): the sequence A is a permutation of the integers 1 through N
Subtask #2 (50 points): original constraints

                        Sample Input 1
                        





2
4 1
1 4 2 3
4 2
1 4 2 3



                        Sample Output 1
                        





yes
no


Explanation
Example case 1: We may freely swap adjacent elements, so the sequence can be sorted e.g. in the following way: (1,4,2,3)→(1,2,4,3)→(1,2,3,4).
