Consider NN binary variables x1,x2,…,xNx1,x2,…,xN. For each valid ii, the i-th of these variables can be xi=0 or xi=1; therefore, there are 2N possible assignments of values to the variables. For each valid i, setting xi=1 gives you score gi.
In addition, there are M special intervals (numbered 1 through M). For each valid i, the i-th interval is [ui,vi] and if xui=xui+1=…=xvi=1, then your score increases by di.
Note that both gi and di can be negative (setting more variables to 1 can decrease your score), and your score can also be negative. Formally, the score of an assignment of values to the binary variables is
N∑i=1gi⋅xi+M∑i=1di⋅vi∏j=uixj.
Find the K highest scores among all assignments on these variables. Formally, if we computed the scores of all 2N assignments and sorted them in non-increasing order, you should find the first K of these values.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers g1,g2,…,gN.
M lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers ui, vi and di.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing K space-separated integers ― the K highest scores of assignments on the binary variables, in decreasing order.
