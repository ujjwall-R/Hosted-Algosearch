There are three distinct points - A,B,CA,B,C in the X−YX−Y plane. Initially, you are located at point A. You want to reach the point C satisfying the following conditions:

You have to go through point B. 
You can move in any of the four axis-parallel directions (+X, −X, +Y, −Y direction). However, you can make at most one turn in the path from A to C. 

Determine if it is possible to reach the destination C satisfying the above conditions.
NOTE:  

One turn means 90∘  clockwise or anticlockwise rotation along the direction of movement. For example, if you are moving towards the +X direction, after one turn you can move either in the +Y direction or in the −Y direction. Changing the direction by 180∘ is not allowed.

Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers XA,YA, denoting the coordinates of the starting point A.
The second line of each test case contains two space-separated integers XB,YB, denoting the coordinates of the point B.
The third line of each test case contains two space-separated integers XC,YC, denoting the coordinates of the finishing point C.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one string - "YES"(without quotes) if it is possible to reach the finishing point satisfying the above conditions, otherwise print "NO"(without quotes).
Constraints

Explanation

Test case 1:  You start moving in the +Y direction from A=(1,1), after two-unit steps you reach the point B=(1,3). Then you make a clockwise turn at point B and start moving towards the +X direction. After two-unit steps, you reach the finishing point C=(3,3).
Test case 2:  There is no possible way to reach the finishing point C satisfying the above conditions. You have to make at least two turns in the path.
Test case 3:  You start moving in the −X direction from A=(5,2) . After 4 unit steps, you reach the finish point C=(1,2). In the path from A to C, you go through the point B=(3,2) and don't make any turn.
