Dai Ma Chu Shi is a Chinese CodeChef.
He recently got a huge chocolate with the size 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × n. (Yes, in five-dimensional space).
He wants to cut it into 8n pieces of small chocolate of size 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 2 each. Please notice that the direction doesn't matter, 1 × 1 × 1 × 2 × 1 and 2 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 1  are acceptable.

He wants to know how many ways he can achieve this feat in. Because the answer is very large, please tell him the answer modulo 109+7.
Input
First line of input contain a single integer T, the number of test cases. T tests follow. Each test case contain a single integer n.
Output
For each test case output a single line containing the answer for the problem modulo 109+7.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ n ≤ 109
Subtask 1 (30 points), n is a power of 2.
Subtask 2 (70 points), Original constraints
