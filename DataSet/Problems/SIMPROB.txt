Problem Description -
Kansuler is good with finding X in maths. no matter how hard the question is, he never fails. He finds the answer without any difficulty. But as the questions keep on repeating with just a minor change in variables, He no longer wants to solve them. Rather he hires you to code a program to solve equations. Can you help Kansuler solve equations? (equations are only quadratic equations)
Constrains
 1<=TestCase<20
0<=a,b,c<10^6
Input
First line of program will contain number of test case
Each test case contain three space separated Integers a,b,c
Output
If roots are not possible then output "No Roots" (case sensitive & quotes for clarity)
else print both roots (print positive first then negative)
Sample Input
1
2 3 1
Sample Output
-0.5
