Problem Statement
Your hunter friend Sova has a crush on Reyna. Reyna has finally decided to go for a date with Sova ( In a hypothetical world of course ). Sova being a highly desperate fellow wants to reach her as soon as possible and keep her from waiting as Reyna is a short tempered person.
Sova has lost his recon bow that locates people and is unable to find out the path to reach Reyna. Sova needs your help in finding a path to reach his love Reyna.
Sova’s city (icebox) can be represented as a N * M  grid consisting of N rows and M columns. You are given one starting point  V ( Sova’s current location in icebox), one ending point  S  (Reyna’s location in icebox) and the rest of the points as either P or O.  P denotes an obstacle meaning you cannot pass through it while O denotes a valid cell you can pass through.
You can move in any of the four directions i.e. if you are at point (i,j) you can move to
( i , j + 1)
( i , j - 1 )
( i + 1 , j)
( i - 1 ,  j)   
Input Format
The first line contains 2 space separated integers N, M denoting dimensions of the grid.
Next N lines contain M characters each without spaces consisting of P ’s,  O ’s, V and S . The input contains exactly one  V and exactly one S.
Constraints
4 ≤ N  *  M ≤ 100000   
Output Format
Print a single line containing minimum steps that Sova needs to reach Reyna’s location.
Sample Input
3 3
OVO
OPO
SOO   
Sample Output
3   
Explanation
There exist 2 possible paths from V to S. The path (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) is the shortest that requires 3 steps.
