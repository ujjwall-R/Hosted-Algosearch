Consider the following algorithm, which generates a (not necessarily uniformly) random permutation of numbers 11 through NN:
P := [1, 2, ..., N]
for i in 1..N do
    j := rand(1, N)
    swap(P[i], P[j])

Here, rand(1, N) returns a uniformly random integer between 11 and N inclusive. Let's denote the probability that the permutation generated by this algorithm is P by p(P).
Find a permutation P1 such that p(P1) is maximum possible and a permutation P2 such that p(P2) is minimum possible.
Input
The first and only line of the input contains a single integer N.
Output
Print two lines. The first line should contain N space-separated integers denoting your permutation P1. The second line should contain N space-separated integers denoting your permutation P2.
If there are multiple answers, you may print any one.

                        Sample Input 1
                        





2



                        Sample Output 1
                        





1 2
2 1


Explanation
There are two possible permutations, [1,2] and [2,1]. Both are equally likely to appear as the result of the given algorithm, so any pair of permutations is a valid answer.
