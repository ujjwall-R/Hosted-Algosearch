Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line the minimum number of matches RCB must win to qualify for playoffs.

1≤T≤10000
1≤X≤100
1≤Y≤100
1≤X≤2⋅Y

2
10 5

5
0


Explanation

In first case X=10 and Y=5, so RCB needs 10 points from remaining 5 matches to qualify for playoffs. It is only possible if they win all their remaining 5 matches.
In second case X=1 and Y=5, so RCB needs 1 points from their remaining 5 matches to qualify for playoffs. It can be done if they tie any one of their 5 matches and lose the remaining 4. So they need to win 0 matches.
