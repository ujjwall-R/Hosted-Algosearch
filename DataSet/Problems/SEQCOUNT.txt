 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
Consider the sequence of K natural numbers: a1, a2, ..., aK. Tooru thinks that this sequence is nice if and only if:
a1+a2+...+aK = N
a1 < a2 < ... < aK
ai+1 - ai <= D for every natural i, smaller than K
a1 <= D

You are given N, K and D. Please, count the number of nice sequences for her. This number can be huge, so we ask you to output it modulo 109+7.

Input
The first and only line of the input consists of the integers N, K and D, separated by a single space.
Output
Output the number of nice sequences on the first line of the output modulo 109+7.
Example
Input:
10 4 1

Output:
1

Explanation
The only suitable sequence is (1, 2, 3, 4).
Scoring
1 <= N, K, D <= 10 : 17 points.
1 <= N, K, D <= 400 : 23 points. 1 <= N, K, D <= 2000 : 20 points.
1 <= N, K, D <= 105 : 40 points.
