Given an array A of size N and a list of Q number of queries, where each query has two numbers L and R, find for each query the number of inversions in the subarray from Lth to Rth position (both inclusive) of the array A( array has 1-based index).
For an array A two elements A[i] and A[j] form an inversion if A[i] > A[j] and i < j. Help them to solve this problem.

 
Input

First line contains a single integer, length N of the array.
Second line has N space separated numbers, where ith element is A[i].
Third line has a single integer Q.
Next Q lines have 2 space separated integers L and R of that query.

Output

Output Q lines, ith line having a single integer, the answer to the ith query

 
Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 20000
0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ Q ≤ 20000
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N
