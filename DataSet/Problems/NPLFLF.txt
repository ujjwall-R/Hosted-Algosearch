Add:  Add a given string to the collection. 
Ask:  Ask if there exists a group of  k  strings such that they have a common suffix of length  l .
Removei:  Remove the string that was added in the ith operation (if the string is not already removed). It is guaranteed that ith operation was an Add operation.




Aniket is tired of the mid-sem exams he has just had. Can you help him do all these operations and find the answers of all Ask operations.

Input
First line of input contains an integer q denoting the total number of operations Harsh does. q lines follow in the following format.

 1 s  Add the string s(all lowercase characters) to Aniket's collection of strings.
 2 k l  Ask if there exists a group of k strings such that they have a common suffix of length l.
 3 x Remove the string added in the xth operation (if not already removed).


Output
Print the answer to all the Ask operations in different lines. Print "YES" if it exists else print "NO".
Constraints

1 ≤ q ≤ 105
1 ≤ |s| (sum of lengths of all strings added to the collection) ≤ 105
1 ≤ k,l ≤ 105
1 ≤ x ≤ number of operations done yet

Example
Input 1:
9
1 aba
1 accba
2 2 2
2 2 3
1 aaaa
1 ababa
2 3 2
3 1
2 3 2


Output 1:
YES
NO
YES
NO
