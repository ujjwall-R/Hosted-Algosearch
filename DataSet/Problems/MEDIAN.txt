Little Elephant from Zoo of Lviv likes medians so much. Let us define median term for some array A. Let B be the same array A, but sorted in non-decreasing order. Median of A is Bm (1-based indexing), where m equals to (n div 2)+1. Here 'div' is an integer division operation. So, for a sorted array with 5 elements, median is the 3rd element and for a sorted array with 6 elements, it is the 4th element.

Little Elephant has an array A with n integers. In one turn he can apply the following operation to any consecutive subarray A[l..r]: assign to all Ai (l <= i <= r) median of subarray A[l..r].

Let max be the maximum integer of A. Little Elephant wants to know the minimum number of operations needed to change A to an array of n integers each with value max.

For example, let A = [1, 2, 3]. Little Elephant wants to change it to [3, 3, 3]. He can do this in two operations, first for subarray A[2..3] (after that A equals to [1, 3, 3]), then operation to A[1..3].

Input
First line of the input contains single integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow, each of such format: first line - integer n, second line - array A consisted of n integers.

Output
In T lines print the results for each test case, one per line.

Constraints

1 <= T <= 100

1 <= n <= 30

1 <= A[i] <= 10^9
