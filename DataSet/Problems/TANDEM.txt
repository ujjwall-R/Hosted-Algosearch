The chef was recently studying about repeated occurrences of substrings in the strings. In particular, he was studying about a string s.


He calls a string to be in tandem if it can be represented as concatenation of three equal strings, i.e. it can be represented as AAA where A is a non-empty string. For brevity, he calls such strings tandem strings. For example, "ababab" is a tandem string whereas "abab" is not.


Now, Chef is studying tandem substrings of string s. He calls a tandem substring an interesting tandem if the character following the substring in string s (if it exists) is different than the first character of the substring. If the character following the tandem substring does not exist (i.e. the substring appears as a suffix of string s), it's also called interesting tandem.


Chef calls all the tandem substrings which are not interesting tandem as boring tandems.


Now, chef wants your help in counting number of interesting and boring tandem substrings in string s. Please help him!!


For example, let s be "abaaabaaabaaabbbb".

The substring s[3..14] = "aaabaaabaaab" is an interesting tandem, as the substring is a tandem and the character following the substring (i.e. s[15] = 'b') is different than the first character of the substring (i.e. 'a').
The substring s[1..12] = "abaaabaaabaa" is a boring tandem, as the character following the tandem substring (i.e. s[13] = 'a') is same as the first character of the substring (i.e. 'a').
The substring s[15..17] = "bbb" is also an interesting tandem as the character following the tandem does not exist (i.e. this tandem substring appears as a suffix of string s).

In summary, s[1..12], s[2..13], s[3..14], s[3..5], s[7..9], s[11..13], s[14..16], s[15..17] are all tandem substrings. Out of which, s[3..14], s[3..5], s[7..9], s[11..13], s[15..17] are all interesting tandems. Rest tandem substrings, s[1..12], s[2..13], s[14..16] are all boring tandems.
Input
There is only a single test case.
The first line of the input contains a string s.
Output
The only line of the output should contain two space separated integers denoting the number of interesting and boring tandems in string, respectively.
Constraints

1 ≤ |s| ≤ 200000
s consists of lower case English alphabets ('a' to 'z')


                        Sample Input 1
                        





abaaabaaabaaabbbb



                        Sample Output 1
                        





5 3


Explanation
Example case 1. It is already explained in the problem statement.
