Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, three integers a,b,c. 

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line answer "YES"(if triangle possible) and area of triangle correct upto five decimal places space separated. Otherwise "NO".
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤a,b,c≤107

Sample Input:
2
 3 4 5
 2 4 7
Sample Output:
YES 6.00000
 NO
EXPLANATION:
For 1st test case Triangle is possible. And area is 6.00000
