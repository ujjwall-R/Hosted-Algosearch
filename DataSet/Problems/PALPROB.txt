Let us define the palindromeness of a string in the following way:


If the string is not a palindrome, its' palindromeness is zero.
The palindromeness of an one-letter string is 1.
The palindromness of a string S of the length greater than one is 1 + "palindromeness of the string that is formed by the first [|S|/2] symbols of S".


Let us consider some examples for better understanding:


The palindromeness of the string zxqfd is 0, since the string is not a palindrome.
The palindromeness of the string a is 1, by definition.
The palindromeness of the string aa is 2, beucase for "aa" we get 1 + palindromeness of "a", that is one, so we get 2.
The palindromeness of the string abacaba is 3.


You are given a string S. Find the sum of the palindromenesses of all the non empty substrings of  S (i.e. S[i..j], where i <= j). In other words, you have to calculate the sum of palindromenesses of N * (N + 1) / 2 substrings of S, where N is the length of S.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of every test case contains a single string S for the corresponding test case.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the answer to the problem.
Constraints


1 ≤ T ≤ 3
S consists only of lower-case Latin letters.

Explanation
Example case 1: There is no palindrome that occurs as the substring of zxqfd and has the length more than 1. The individual characters are palindromes of the palindromeness of 1.
Example case 2: The palindromeness of aba is 2 and the sum of the palindromenesses of single characters is 3.
