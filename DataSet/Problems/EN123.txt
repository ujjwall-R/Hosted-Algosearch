First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Second line contains N and K, the number of dishes that they order and Debanjan's bank balance..

Output:
For each testcase, output in a new line, if Debanjan can pay the bill alone or not. Print "YES"(without quotes) if he can, else print "NO"(without quotes).
Constraints :

1≤T≤10
1≤N≤100
1≤Ai≤100
1≤K≤104

Sample Input:
2
3 200
60 30 70
4 100

50 50 30 90
