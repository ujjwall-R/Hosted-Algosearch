Let's define a 10-string as a string that contains only characters '1' and '0', starts with '1' and ends with '0'. For example, "10101010", "100" or "1010" are 10-strings, while "011", "11120" or "10101" are not.
A subsequence of any 10-string is called humongous if it is of the form "1010...10" ("10" concatenated an arbitrary number of times).
For example, the 10-string "110" contains exactly 2 humongous subsequences and "1010" contains exactly 4 humongous subsequences (formed using indices {1, 2}, {3, 4}, {1, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4}).
You should process some really humongous queries. Each query is as follows:

You're given a 10-string S and an integer X.
You should convert S into another 10-string U by flipping a number of characters (possibly zero; a flip means changing a '1' to '0' or '0' to '1') of S.
The string U should contain exactly X humongous subsequences.
The answer to the query is the minimum number of flips that need to be performed. If it's impossible to convert S into a valid string U, the answer doesn't exist.


Note that U has to be a 10-string.
For each query, compute the minimum possible number of flips or determine that there is no answer.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single string S.
The second line contains a single integer X.

Output
For each test case:

If there is no answer, print a single line containing one string "NO" (without quotes).
If an answer exists, print two lines.
The first line should contains a single string "YES" (without quotes).
The second line should contain a single integer denoting the minimum necessary number of flips.

Explanation
Example case 1: We can convert the given 10-string into U = "1010" using only one flip; this string has exactly 4 humongous subsequences. This is the minimum possible number of flips.
Example case 2: The only 10-strings we can obtain after any number of flips are "100" and "110". Each of them contains exactly 2 humongous subsequences, so there is no answer.
