You are given n points p1, p2, ..., pn in a plane and n integers a1, a2, ..., an.
For any index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), it is possible to perform the following operation (let's call it i-rotation) on an arbitrary point P: Rotate P by ai degrees counter-clockwise around the point pi.

Note that ai will always be a multiple of 90. Also note that such an operation changes the point P.
You should process q queries. Each query is of one of the following types:

1 x y l r: Initially, you are given P = (x, y). Perform each i-rotation for i = l, l+1, ..., r (in this order) on the point P. Compute the coordinates of P modulo 109 + 7 after performing all i-rotations.
2 u x y b: Change the point pu to (x, y) and the angle au to b.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n.
Then, n lines follow. The i-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers xi, yi and ai. The i-th point is initially pi = (xi, yi).
The next line contains a single integer q denoting the number of queries.
Each of the following q lines contains a query in the format described above.

Output
For each query of type 1, print a single line containing two space-separated integers denoting the coordinates of the point P after performing all rotations, modulo 109 + 7.
