Chef sometimes suffers from insomnia. During sleepless nights, he often plays this game: He creates an array A of N integers and also decides one integer K. After that, he tries to count the number of non-empty contiguous subsequences (subsegments) of A, such that there are no bad pairs of integers in this subsegment. A pair (x, y) of integers is called bad if x is situated to the left of y in the array and x mod y = K. Finally, before going to sleep, Chef wrote down the answer on a sheet of paper. Sadly, he has forgotten it this morning and want your help regarding that.
Input

The first line contains two integers - N and K.
Second line contains N integers - A1, A2 ... AN - separated by spaces, denoting the array A.

Output
A single line containing an integer - the answer to the problem.
Constraints

1 ≤ N, Ai ≤ 105 
0 ≤ K ≤ 105 

Subtasks

Subtask 1: N ≤ 100 (15 points) 
Subtask 2: N ≤ 1000 (15 points) 
Subtask 3: K = 0 (10 points) 
Subtask 4: Original constraints (60 points)
