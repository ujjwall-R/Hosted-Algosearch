 
Consider a numeric string str where stri denotes the digit(0 to 9) at index i. We call (x1, x2, x3, x4)
quadruple a palindromic quadruple of string S if it satisfies the following criteria : Sx1 = Sx4 and Sx2 = Sx3
where x1 < x2 < x3 < x4.
You are given Q queries where each query is of form :

1 i j : Print number of different palindromic quadruples (x1, x2, x3, x4) for string str such that
i ≤ x1 < x2 < x3 < x4 ≤ j. As the result can be large, print it modulo 109 + 7.
2 idx ch : Replace stridx with character ch.


 
Input
The first line contains a string str
The second line contains a single integer, Q, the number of queries.
Each of the next Q lines contains a query, with format as described in the problem statement.
 
Output
An integer for each query of type 1, one on each line.
 
Constraints

|str| ≤ 5 × 104
stri, ch ∈ {0, 1, . . . , 9}
1 ≤ Q ≤ 105
1 ≤ i ≤  j  ≤ |str|
1 ≤ idx ≤ |str|

 
Example
Input:
01010
5
1 1 5
2 2 0
1 1 5
2 4 0
1 1 5
Output:
1
1
5

 
Explanation

Query 1: The String is "01010", Possible palindromic quadruples = {"0110"}, so answer = 1
Query 2: Update str2 = 0, so the string is now "00010"
Query 3: The String is "00010", Possible palindromic quadruples = {"0000"}, so answer = 1
Query 4: Update str4 = 0, so the string is now "00000"
Query 5: The String is "00000", Possible palindromic quadruples is "0000" which can be selected in 5 ways, so answer = 5
