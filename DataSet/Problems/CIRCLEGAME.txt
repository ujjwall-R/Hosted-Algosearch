Aujasvit just came up with a new game to play with his friends. NN people stand in a circle, each assigned an index from 11 to NN in clockwise order. Then the following operation is done N−1 times.

The person with the lowest index holds a coin.
Then, the coin then moves to the next person clockwise M−1 times.
Then, the person who is holding the coin is removed from the circle.

The last person remaining after N−1 operations is the winner.
Aujasvit has already decided on the integer M to be used in the game. Before inviting people to play his game, Aujasvit wants to know the winner if the game has 1 player, 2 players, 3 players, …, X players. That is, you need to output the winner when N=1,N=2,...,N=X.
Input Format

The first line of each input contains T - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.
The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers M and X.

Output Format
For each testcase, output X integers A1,A2,…,AX, where Ai is the index of the winner if i people are playing this game.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
1≤M≤109
1≤X≤10000
Sum of X over all testcases is not more than 5⋅105

                        Sample Output 1
                        





1 1 1


Explanation

Test case 1:
When there is only 1 player, they are the winner. Therefore player 1 wins.
When there are 2 players, player 2 is removed in the first round. Therefore player 1 wins.
When there are 3 players, player 2 is removed in the first round, and player 3 is removed in the second round. Therefore player 1 wins.
