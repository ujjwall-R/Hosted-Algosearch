Two drunken players Alice and Bob are playing a modified version of Tic-Tac-Toe.
Initially, there is a N×M empty grid.
Alice and Bob take alternate turns starting with Alice. In her turn, Alice chooses an empty cell on the board and puts a "A" on the chosen cell. In Bob's turn, he chooses an empty cell and puts a "B" on the chosen cell.
The player who first gets any K×K subgrid completely filled with his/her initial wins the game. By a K×K subgrid, we mean the intersection of K consecutive rows and K consecutive columns. The players do not stop making turns after one of them wins and they play all N⋅M turns until the grid is filled.
You are given the sequence of moves played by each player (The cell selected by the player in his/her turn). You have to output the winner of the game or report that there is no winner.
Input

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains three integers N, M, K.
Each of the next N⋅M lines contains two integers X, Y (the row and column of the cell chosen by the player with the current turn)

Output
For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins the game or "Bob" if Bob wins the game or "Draw" if no one wins.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤N,M≤1000
1≤K≤min(N,M)
1≤X≤N
1≤Y≤M
The sum of N⋅M over all test cases does not exceed 106.

Subtasks
Subtask 1 (10 points): 1≤N≤10, 1≤M≤10
Subtask 2 (20 points): 1≤N≤50, 1≤M≤50
Subtask 3 (70 points): Original Constraints
Sample Input

1 2
2 3
2 1

Sample Output
Bob

Explanation
After 10 turns of the game the state of the grid is:
AAA.
A.BB
BABB

At this moment, Bob has achieved a subgrid of 2×2 with his initials while Alice has not achieved it yet so Bob is the winner.
