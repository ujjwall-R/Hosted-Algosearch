Chef likes problems with arrays. Let's call an array V dominating if there exists a number x (the dominator) whose number of occurrences is strictly greater than half the size of the array (that is, floor(|V|/2)).


For example, the arrays {1, 2, 1} is dominating, with the number 1 being the dominator, since half the size of the array is 1, while the number 1 occurs twice. Similarly, the array {1, 1, 1, 2} is dominating. On the other hand, the arrays {1, 2, 3} and {1, 2, 2, 1} are not dominating.

Given an array A consisting of N positive integers, you need to help Chef find the number of subarrays of A which are dominating.
Input
The first line of input contains one integer N denoting the number of elements in the array A. The second line of input contains N space-separated integers denoting the array A.

Output
Output the answer to the query in a single line.
Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 5 × 105
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 109

Example
Input:
5
1 2 1 2 1

Output:
9

Input:
7
1 2 3 3 2 1 3

Output:
11

Subtask 3:  N ≤ 105. Points - 30
Subtask 4: Original constraints. Points - 40

Explanation

Test #1:
The dominating subarrays are A[1..1], A[2..2], A[3..3], A[4..4], A[5..5], A[6..6], A[1..3], A[2..4], A[3..5].
Test #2:
The dominating subarrays are A[1..1], A[2..2], A[3..3], A[4..4], A[5..5], A[6..6], A[7..7], A[3..4], A[2..4], A[3..5], A[3..7].
