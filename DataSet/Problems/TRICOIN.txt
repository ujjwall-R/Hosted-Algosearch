Chef belongs to a very rich family which owns many gold mines. Today, he brought N gold coins and decided to form a triangle using these coins. Isn't it strange?
Chef has a unusual way of forming a triangle using gold coins, which is described as follows:
He puts 1 coin in the 1st row.
then puts 2 coins in the 2nd row.
then puts 3 coins in the 3rd row.
 and so on as shown in the given figure.
Chef is interested in forming a triangle with maximum possible height using at most N coins. Can you tell him the maximum possible height of the triangle?
Input
The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. 
The first and the only line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of gold coins Chef has.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the maximum possible height of the triangle that Chef can get.
Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 109
Subtasks
Subtask 1 (48 points) : 1 ≤ N ≤ 105
Subtask 2 (52 points) : 1 ≤ N ≤ 109

Explanation
Test 1: Chef can't form a triangle with height > 2 as it requires atleast 6 gold coins.
Test 2: Chef can't form a triangle with height > 2 as it requires atleast 6 gold coins.
Test 3: Chef can't form a triangle with height > 3 as it requires atleast 10 gold coins.
