You are given an integer AA. Let's define an infinite sequence S(A)=A%P,A2%P,A3%P,…S(A)=A%P,A2%P,A3%P,…, where P=108+7P=108+7 is a prime and % is the modulo operator.
Let's also define a decreasing sum D(S) as the sum of all elements of a sequence S which are strictly smaller than all preceding elements of S. When S is a sequence of non-negative integers, the number of such elements is clearly finite.
Find D(S(A)).
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer A.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer D(S(A)).
Constraints

1≤T≤500
2≤A<P

Explanation
Example case 1: The sequence S(2) is 2,4,8,…,1,2,… and thus, D(S(2))=2+1=3.
Example case 2: The sequence is 108+6,1,108+6,1,… and thus, D(S(108+6))=108+6+1=108+7.
