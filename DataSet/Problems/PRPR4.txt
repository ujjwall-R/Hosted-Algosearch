After Lee Sedol lost to Alpha GO AI, he meets his counterpart Garry Kasparov to 
find solace. What started as a calm conversation soon turns into a heated argument
as they decide to challenge themselves in a game of Konkatonka.
In the most common form of Konkatonka, a transparent box is kept and filled with plastic
 cubes marked with numbers 1 to M where M is a natural number. The players take 
    alternative turns until the end of the game. In each turn, a player picks a cube,
    marked x and also all the cubes marked with divisors of x out of the box. The game
 goes on till all the cubes in the box are removed. The player to pick up the last cube 
remaining inside the box is the winner.

Input
First Line : a natural number t indicating the number of test cases
    In each line of the test case, two integers are given separated by a single space.
    The first integer M is the number of plastic cubes in the box. The second 
    integer represents the player who starts - "0" means Lee Sedol starts the game and 
    "1" means Garry Kasparov starts the game (0 and 1 are integers and are given
    in quotes only for clarity). 


Output
Each line of the output should either contain "Lee Sedol wins." or "Garry Kasparov wins."
It is possible to determine a winner if both, Sedol and Kasparov play optimally


Example
Input:
    1
    1 0

Output:
    Lee Sedol wins.
