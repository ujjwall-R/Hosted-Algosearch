You are given a permutation p1,p2,…,pNp1,p2,…,pN. Let's denote a contiguous subsequence pl,pl+1,…,prpl,pl+1,…,pr in it by [l,r] and call it interesting if max(pl,pl+1,…,pr)−min(pl,pl+1,…,pr)=r−l.
Next, let's say that two interesting subsequences [a,b] and [c,d] are nested if a≤c≤d≤b or c≤a≤b≤d, and they are interleaved if max(a,c)≤min(b,d), but they are not nested. The intersection of two such interleaved subsequences is the subsequence [max(a,c),min(b,d)].
You need to find the number of ordered pairs of interesting contiguous subsequences such that they are interleaved and their intersection contains at least X elements. Since this number may be very large, compute it modulo 998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and X.
The second line contains N space-separated integers p1,p2,…,pN.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer ― the number of valid pairs of interesting subsequences modulo 998,244,353.
Constraints

1≤X≤N≤300000
1≤pi≤N for each valid i
p1,p2,…,pN are pairwise distinct.
