Explanation
Test Case 1: The duration of the only episode is 10 minutes, and the exam starts exactly after 10 minutes. So, Chef will not be able to finish watching Season-1 strictly before the exam starts.
Test Case 2: There are two episodes in Season-1, each of duration 10 minutes. Therefore, Chef will require 10+10=20 minutes to finish watching Season-1. As the exam starts after 25 minutes, Chef will be able to finish watching Season-1 strictly before the exam starts.
Test Case 3: There are two episodes in Season-1, each of duration 10 minutes. Therefore, Chef will require 10+10=20 minutes to finish watchin Season-1. As the exam starts after 15 minutes, Chef will not be able to finish watching Season-1 strictly before the exam starts.
