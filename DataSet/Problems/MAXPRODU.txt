You are given two integers NN and KK. Consider all ways to represent NN as the sum of exactly KK distinct positive integers x1,x2,…,xKx1,x2,…,xK — in other words, xi>0xi>0 for each valid ii, xi≠xj for each valid i≠j and x1+x2+…+xK=N should hold.
You have to find the maximum possible value of the product (x21−x1)⋅(x22−x2)⋅…⋅(x2K−xK). Because this number could be huge, compute it modulo 109+7. If N cannot be represented as the sum of any K distinct positive integers, output −1 instead.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K. 

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum product, or −1 if N cannot be represented in the given way.

Example Input
2
5 2
6 2

Example Output
12
24

Explanation
Example case 1: We want two distinct positive integers whose sum is 5. There are only two possibilities: (1,4) and (2,3). The corresponding products are (12−1)⋅(42−4)=0 and (22−2)⋅(32−3)=2⋅6=12. The maximum is 12, which is the answer.
Example case 2: We want two distinct positive integers whose sum is 6. There are only two possibilities again: (1,5) and (2,4). Their corresponding products are 0 and 24 and the maximum is 24.
