Alice and Bob are playing a game.
First, Alice throws N darts at a board with dimensions 109×109 at random. Each dart hits the board at a point (some of these points may coincide). Then, Bob should answer Alice's Q questions. In each question, Alice chooses two integers l and r; Bob should only consider all points hit in throws l through r (inclusive) and compute the distance between the farthest pair of these points.
Help Bob find the answers to all queries.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N denoting the number of points.
N lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers xi and yi denoting the coordinates of the point hit with the i-th dart.
The next line contains a single integer Q denoting the number of queries.
Each of the following Q lines contains two space-separated integers l and r describing one query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the square of the maximum distance. (It is guaranteed that this number is an integer.)
