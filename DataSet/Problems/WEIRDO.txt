Alice and Bob created NN and MM recipes, respectively (N,M≥1), and submitted them to Chef for evaluation. Each recipe is represented by a string containing only lowercase English letters. Let's denote Alice's recipes by A1,A2,…,AN and Bob's recipes by B1,B2,…,BM.
Accidentally, Chef mixed up those recipes ― now, he has L=N+M recipes in a sequence S1,S2,…,SL. Thankfully, the recipes created by Alice and Bob are distinguishable from each other. It is well-known that for each recipe s created by Alice, the following property holds, and for each recipe created by Bob, it does not hold: For each 1≤l<r≤|s|, the substring sl,sl+1,…,sr contains at least as many vowels as consonants. The letters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' are vowels, while the other letters are consonants.
The score of a candidate who made K recipes is calculated as the product of xcfxKc for all letters c that occur in at least one of these recipes; here, xc is the number of recipes which contain the letter c and fxc is the total number of occurrences of this letter in all K recipes.
Let's denote the scores of Alice and Bob by scA and scB respectively. Chef wants to know their ratio scA/scB. We know that Chef is a legendary cook, but he is not very good at calculating, so he is asking you to find that number.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer L.
L lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains a single string Si.

Output
For each test case, if the ratio of scores exceeds 107, print a single line containing the string "Infinity" (without quotes); otherwise, print a single line containing one real number scA/scB.
Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10−6. It is guaranteed that scA/scB does not lie in the range 107±10.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
2≤L≤105
2≤|Si|≤105 for each valid i
for each valid i, Si contains only lowercase English letters
the sum of |S1|+|S2|+…+|SL| over all test cases does not exceed 107

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (25 points):

L≤10
|Si|≤10 for each valid i

Subtask #2 (75 points): original constraints

Explanation
Example case 1: The recipes "aba" and "aac" are created by Alice, while the recipes "abc" and "bab" are created by Bob. The scores are:

scA=xafxNa⋅xbfxNb⋅xcfxNc=242⋅112⋅112=18
scB=xafxMa⋅xbfxMb⋅xcfxMc=222⋅232⋅112=19
scAscB=1/81/9=1.125
