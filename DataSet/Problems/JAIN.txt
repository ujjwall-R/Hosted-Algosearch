Chef has NN dishes, numbered 11 through NN. For each valid i, dish i is described by a string Di containing only lowercase vowels, i.e. characters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'.
A meal consists of exactly two dishes. Preparing a meal from dishes i and j (i≠j) means concatenating the strings Di and Dj in an arbitrary order into a string M describing the meal. Chef likes this meal if the string M contains each lowercase vowel at least once.
Now, Chef is wondering - what is the total number of (unordered) pairs of dishes such that he likes the meal prepared from these dishes?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
N lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains a single string Di.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the number of ways to prepare a meal Chef likes.
Constraints

1≤T≤1,000
1≤N≤105
1≤|Di|≤1,000 for each valid i
the sum of all |D_i| over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅107

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (20 points):

1≤T≤100
1≤N≤100
the sum of all |D_i| over all test cases does not exceed 20000

Explanation
Example case 1: There are three possible meals:

A meal prepared from dishes 1 and 2 (for example "aaooaoaooauiieieiieieuuu") contains all vowels.
A meal prepared from dishes 1 and 3 (for example "aaooaoaooaaeioooeeiiaiei") does not contain 'u'.
A meal prepared from dishes 2 and 3 (for example "uiieieiieieuuuaeioooeeiiaiei") contains all vowels.
