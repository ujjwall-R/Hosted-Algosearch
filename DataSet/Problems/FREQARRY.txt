A beautiful sequence is defined as a sequence that do not have any repeating elements in it.
You will be given any random sequence of integers, and you have to tell whether it is a beautiful sequence or not. 
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT. TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases is as follows.
The next line of the input contains a single integer N. N denotes the total number of elements in the sequence.
The next line of the input contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,A3...An denoting the sequence.

Output:

Print "prekrasnyy"(without quotes) if the given sequence is a beautiful sequence, else print "ne krasivo"(without quotes)

Note: each test case output must be printed on new line
Constraints:

1≤T≤102
1≤N≤103
1≤A1,A2,A3...An≤105

Sample Input:
2
4
1 2 3 4
6
1 2 3 5 1 4

Sample Output:
prekrasnyy
ne krasivo

Explanation:

As 1st sequence do not have any elements repeating, hence it is a beautiful sequence
As in 2nd sequence the element 1 is repeated twice, hence it is not a beautiful sequence
