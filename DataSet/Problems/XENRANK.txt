Xenny reverse-engineered all the binaries released by the International Security Agency (ISA)
during summer vacation just to pass time. As a reward, the ISA gave him infinite ByteCoins.
Out of sheer boredom and a sense of purposelessness in life, Xenny decided to arrange the Coins on a 2-Dimensional Euclidean Plane.
The boredom was so strong that he arranged these coins in a specific pattern, as opposed to the usual, monotonous way of storing coins in a Piggy Bank.
On each integer co-ordinate (x, y) where x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0, a single coin was placed. And each coin was assigned a rank. The following pattern was followed in the arrangement:
Let's denote the co-ordinates of the kth coin by (xk, yk) and its rank by Rk.

For any 2 coins i, j:


if (xi + yi) < (xj + yj) or ( (xi + yi) == (xj + yj) and xi < xj)


then Ri < Rj. We sort all the coins by this comparison.


The index of the coin (C) in this sorted list of coins (1-indexed) is its rank.

Each query is as follows: Given (U, V). Among the coins that are lying on or inside the rectangle with
its diagonal end-points being (0, 0) and (U, V),
which is the coin that has the maximum rank?
Input

The first line contains an integer, T - the number of testcases.

Each testcase contains 2 space-separated integers: U, V.

Output
For each testcase, print the rank of the maximum ranked coin, on a new line.

Constraints

  Subtask 1: (40 points)
  1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ U, V ≤ 100

  Subtask 2: (60 points)
  1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ U, V ≤ 109
