Being a newcomer to Computopia, Chef is confused by the countless subway lines in the city. Help him!
You are given an undirected graph with NN vertices and MM edges. There are no self-loops and no simple cycles that contain more than 2 edges in the graph (i.e. if we replaced each set of multiple edges connecting the same pair of vertices by one edge, we would obtain a tree). Each edge also has a colour.
Consider a simple path with length KK in the graph that passes through edges with colours A1,A2,…,AK in this order. The cost of this path is defined as (A1≠A2)+(A2≠A3)+⋯+(AK−1≠AK), where the boolean value true is interpreted as the integer 1 and false is interpreted as 0. In other words, the cost of a simple path is the number of pairs of neighbouring (consecutive) edges on this path with different colours. The cost of a path with length 0 is defined to be 0.
You need to answer Q queries. In each query, you are given vertices u and v; you should find the maximum possible cost of some simple path connecting them.
Note that a simple path may not visit a vertex more than once.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and M.
Each of the next M lines contains three space-separated integers u, v and w denoting an edge between vertices u and v with colour w.
The next line contains an integer Q.
Each of the next Q lines contains two space-separated integers u and v describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum cost of a simple path.
