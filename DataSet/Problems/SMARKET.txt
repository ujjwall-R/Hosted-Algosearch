Sometimes, the stability of a stock market is at least as important as rapid price changes.
Let a stable block be a maximal consecutive block of days with same stock prices.
Moreover, let a stable block of order K be a stable block of length at least K.

For example, if stock prices for 7 consecutive days are: 20, 10, 10, 7, 7, 7, 10, then there are 4 stable blocks there: [20], [10, 10], [7, 7, 7] and [10]. Moreover, there are:


0 stable blocks of order 4 or higher
1 stable block of order 3: [7, 7, 7]
2 stable block of order 2: [10, 10], [7, 7, 7]
4 stable block of order 1: [20], [10, 10], [7, 7, 7] and [10]


Given historical prices of a stock across N days, the goal is to answer Q customers' questions.
The i-th question contains three integers Li, Ri and Ki. It asks for the number of stable blocks of order Ki, if only the stock prices of the days in the range Li, Ri are considered.

Input

In the first line there is a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases to handle. After that the description of T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q, denoting respectively, the number of days for which the stock prices are given, and the number of questions to answer.

The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN, where Ai denotes the price of the stock on the i-th day. 


Q lines follow. In the i-th of them there are three space-separated integers Li, Ri and Ki denoting the i-th query.


Output

For each test case, print answers to all queries in the test case, one per line.

Constraints

Explanation
There are two test cases to handle
Test case #1:
There are 8 days for which prices are given and 5 queries to handle.
The first query asks for the number of stable blocks of order 2 in range [2, 6], which corresponds to prices 10 10 10 7 7. The answer is 2 because there are two such blocks: 10 10 10 and 7 7.
The second query asks for the number of stable blocks of order 2 in range [3, 6], which corresponds to prices 10 10 7 7. The answer is 2 because there are two such blocks: 10 10 and 7 7.
The third query asks for the number of stable blocks of order 3 in range [3, 6], which corresponds to prices 10 10 7 7. The answer is 0 because there is no stable block of order 3 there (maximum order of a stable block is 2).
The fourth query asks for the number of stable blocks of order 3 in range [3, 8], which corresponds to prices 10 10 7 7 7 10. The answer is 1 because the only stable block of order 3 here is 7 7 7.
The fifth query asks for the number of stable blocks of order 1 in range [3, 8], which corresponds to prices 10 10 7 7 7 10. The answer is 3 because there are 3 stable blocks of order 1 there: 10 10, 7 7 7 and 10.

Test case #2:
There are 3 days for which prices are given and 2 queries to handle.
The first query asks for the number of stable blocks of order 1 in range [1, 3], which corresponds to prices 27 27 27. The answer is 1 because the only such block there is 27 27 27.
The second query asks for the number of stable blocks of order 1 in range [2, 2], which corresponds to a single price 27. The answer is 1 because the only such block there is 27.
