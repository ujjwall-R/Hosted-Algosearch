You are given an integer array( A ) of size N and an integer value K.
Find the number of sub-arrays of A, such that the difference between maximum value and minimum value in the sub array is less than or equal to K.
Sub-array is a contiguous portion of an array and two sub-arrays are different if their starting index or ending index is not same.
Input:

First line will contain two integers N and K, size of the array and the difference threshold. 
Second line contains N space separated integers, representing the array elements. 

Output:
Print a single integer, the number of sub-arrays satisfying the above mentioned condition.
Constraints

1≤N≤100000
0≤K,A[i]≤109

Sample Input:
3 2
7 6 14

Sample Output:
4

EXPLANATION:
The sub-arrays which satisfy the condition are 

[7] difference = 0
[6] difference = 0
[14] difference = 0
[7,6] difference = 1
