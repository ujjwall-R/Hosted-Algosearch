There are two types of vehicles in Chefland.

Bus which has a capacity of 100 people.
Car which has a capacity of 4 people.

There are N people who want to travel from place A to place B. You know that a single bus emits X units of smoke while a single car emits Y units of smoke in their journey from A to B.
You want to arrange some buses and cars to carry all these N people such that total smoke emitted is minimized. Output the minimized smoke value.
Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains three integers N, X, Y - the number of people who want to travel, the units of smoke emitted by a bus and the units of smoke emitted by a car respectively.

Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum units of smoke emitted in transporting the N people.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤1000
1≤X,Y≤1000

9 40 8
15 20 20
105 80 10



                        Sample Output 1

100


Explanation
Test case-1: In the optimal case, we will use 3 cars where the 1-st and 2-nd car will carry 4 people each and the 3-rd car will carry 1 person.
Therefore smoke emitted =3×8=24 units. 
Test case-2: In the optimal case, we will use 1 bus to carry all the 15 people.
Therefore smoke emitted =1×20=20 units.
Test case-3: In the optimal case, we will use 1 bus to carry 100 people and use 2 cars to carry the remaining 5 people.
Therefore smoke emitted =1×80+2×10=100 units.
