Explanation

For the first test case Chef, will manufacture 2 cars and will thus use all the 8 tyres and thus could not manufacture any bike.
For the second test case, Chef cannot manufacture any car since there are not enough tyres and will thus manufacture only a single bike which will be purchased by Chef's friend.
For the third test case, Chef will manufacture 1 car and thus use 4 tyres. From the remaining 2 tyres, Chef can manufacture a single bike which will be purchased by Chef's friend.
