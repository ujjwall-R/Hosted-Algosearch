Find the number of sequences with KK elements which satisfy the following conditions:

Each element is an integer between LL and RR inclusive.
The bitwise XOR of all elements is between A and B inclusive.

Since the number of sequences satisfying the given conditions can be quite large, compute it modulo 998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains five space-separated integers L, R, A, B and K.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of valid sequences modulo 998,244,353.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
0≤L≤R<260
0≤A≤B<260
1≤K≤50

Example Input
3
26 54 18 34 1
3 5 4 7 2
2 9 0 100 3

Example Output
9
4
512

EXPLANATION:
In the first testcase, we have to choose one integer in [26,54]∩[18,34]=[26,34]. So, there are 9 ways.
In the second testcase, we have to choose two integers in [3,5] with bitwise xor in [4,7]. There are 4 possible ways:

3⊕4=7
3⊕5=6
4⊕3=7
5⊕3=6.

In the third testcase all 83 possible sequences are valid, hence the answer is 512.
