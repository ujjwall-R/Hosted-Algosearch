Your task is to find the AA and BB − where A is the sword with the shortest height and B with the longest height.

Can you do this?
 
Input:

 The first line of input contains T test cases. 
 For every T test case, the first line will contain an integer N
 The following line will contain N integers − where Ai denotes the size of the sword. 
Output:

There will be a single line output containing two space-separated integers A and B
Constraints:

 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
 1 ≤ N ≤ 105
 1 ≤ Ai  ≤ 106

Sample Input:
1
4
3 4 1 2
Sample Output:
1 4
Sample Input:
In the first test case − 1 is the sword with shortest height and 4 is the sword with longest height.
