Elon Musk has trained N ensembles of neural networks, each given an index from 1 to N, to power a self-replicating robot. Owing to the complexities in interstellar travel, he has space for only one ensemble. Empirically, he finds that the combined intelligence I of the nth ensemble is given by the following equation:

I(n) = Product of the prime factors of n

For example, the intelligence of the 18th ensemble is given by:
I(18) = 2*3 = 6

Given N, help Elon find the index of the ensemble with the maximum intelligence.
(Hint: Brute force will not work for large N. Efficiency of the algorithm is crucial for the survival of the self-replicating bots in deep space.)
