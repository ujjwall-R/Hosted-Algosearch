K0Kalaru47 was out with his friends and he started to tell them about a CP Task. Because the statement was informal, his friends quickly parried with "Who Asked", so here is the formal statement:
Given arrays PP and CC of size (N+K) each, the beauty of an array B of size (N+K) is defined as the sum of Ci for all 1≤i≤(N+K) such that Bi=Pi.
More formally, the beauty of an array B is equal to ∑|B|i=1Ci [Bi=Pi] 
Given an array A of size N such that (1≤Ai≤M). 
Your task is to insert K elements into the array such that:

Each inserted element lies in the range [1,M].
The beauty of the final array is maximized.

Note that, an element can be inserted at any index of the array.
You should find two values: 

The maximum beauty that can be obtained across all arrays of size (N+K).
The number of distinct arrays of size (N+K) having the maximum beauty. Note that, two arrays X and Y are said to be different if there exists some index i such that Xi≠Yi. Since the number of distinct arrays can be huge, print the value modulo MOD.

Input Format

The first line of input consists of 4 integers N,K,M and MOD
The second line of input contains N space-separated integers - the array A.
The third line of input contains (N+K) space-separated integers - the array P.
The fourth line of input contains (N+K) space-separated integers - the array C.

Output Format
Print two integers separated by a single space. 

The first integer corresponds to the maximum beauty that can be obtained across all arrays of size (N+K).
The second integer corresponds to the number of distinct arrays of size (N+K) having the maximum beauty. Since the number of distinct arrays can be huge, print the value modulo MOD.

Constraints

1≤N,K≤2000 
1≤M≤109
2≤MOD≤109
1≤Ai,Pi≤M
−109≤Ci≤109

4 1


Explanation
By inserting one element, we can form the following distinct arrays : 

B=[1,1,1] : The indices where Bi=Pi are {1,3}.
Thus, the beauty is C1+C3=1+2=3.
B=[1,1,2] : The indices where Bi=Pi are {1}.
Thus, the beauty is C1=1.
B=[1,2,1] : The indices where Bi=Pi are {1,2,3}.
Thus, the beauty is C1+C2+C3=1+1+2=4.
B=[2,1,1] : The indices where Bi=Pi are {3}.
Thus, the beauty is C3=2.

Thus, the maximum beauty possible is 4, and the number of arrays with beauty 4 is 1 which is [1,2,1].
