For a number N, find count of occurance of N in twin primes.
Two prime numbers M and N are said to be Twin Primes if |M-N| = 2 
Input
First line contains T - Number of test cases
Next T lines contains a number - N 
Output
For every N, print count of occurance in new line  
Constraint:
1<=T <= 1000
2 <= N <= 100000  
Sample Input
3
11
5
47  
Sample Output
1
2
0  
Explanation
11 is present in one twin prime set (11,13)
5 is present in two twin prime set (3,5) and (5,7)
47 is not present in any twin prime sets
Note
3x time multiplier for java instead of 2x for this problem.
