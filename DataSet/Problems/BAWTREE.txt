You are given an undirected tree having NN nodes. The color of each node is either Black or White.
In one step, you can choose a node uu, toggle the color of the chosen node uu, as well as toggle the colors of all the nodes v, such that {u,v} is an edge in the tree.
Can you find out the minimum number of steps required to make the color of all the nodes black?
Note: Since the input is large, prefer using fast input methods.
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of the T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line of each test case contains N space separated integers A1,A2,...,AN. Ai = 0 represents that the initial color of the ith node is black. Ai = 1 represents that the initial color of the ith node is white.
The following N−1 lines contain two space-separated integers x and y, which denotes that there is an edge between nodes x and y. 

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the minimum number of steps required to make the color of all the nodes black.
Output −1 if it is impossible to make the color of all the nodes black.
Constraints

1≤T≤5⋅104
1≤N≤105
0≤Ai≤1
1≤x,y≤N
The sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅105

Explanation
Test Case 1: All the nodes are already black, so we do not need to do anything.
Test Case 2: All the nodes are white. If we choose node 1 in the first step, all the nodes will become black. Hence, only 1 step is required to make all the nodes black. 
Test Case 3: Choose node 3 in the first step. This will make all the nodes white. Choose node 1 in the second step. This will make all the nodes black.
