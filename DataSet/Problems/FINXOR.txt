This is an interactive problem.
There is a sequence of positive integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. You do not know this sequence, but your task is to find the value of A1⊕A2⊕…⊕ANA1⊕A2⊕…⊕AN, where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
You may ask up to 20 questions. In each question, you should choose an integer K (1≤K≤2⋅106) and the interactor responds with the value of (A1⊕K)+(A2⊕K)+…+(AN⊕K).
Interaction

First, you should read a line containing a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of interaction for T test cases follows.
For each test case, you should start by reading a line containing a single integer N.
To ask a question, you should print a line containing two space-separated integers 1 and K, where 1≤K≤2⋅106. Then, you must read a line containing a single integer ― the answer to your question or −1 if the question is invalid or you asked more than 20 questions.
Finally, you should print a line containing two space-separated integers 2 and X, where X=A1⊕A2⊕…⊕AN. Then, you must read a line containing a single integer: 1 if your answer was correct or −1 if it was incorrect. If your answer was correct, you should continue solving the remaining test cases.

Note that when you receive an answer −1, you should immediately terminate your program to receive a Wrong Answer verdict; otherwise, you may receive any verdict. Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤N≤103
1≤Ai≤106 for each valid i

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (15 points): Ai≤100 for each valid i
Subtask #2 (85 points): original constraints
Example
You             Grader
                1
                4
1 2
                10
1 5 
                18
2 4
                1

Explanation
Example case 1: The hidden sequence is A=[1,2,3,4].

We ask a question with K=2. The grader responds with A1⊕2+A2⊕2+A3⊕2+A4⊕2=10.
Then, we ask a question with K=5 and the grader responds with A1⊕5+A2⊕5+A3⊕5+A4⊕5=18.

Therefore, A1⊕A2⊕A3⊕A4=4.
