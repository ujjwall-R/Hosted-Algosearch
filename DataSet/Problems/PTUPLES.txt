A tuple (a,b,c) is considered good if it consists of three prime numbers a, b and c such that a<b<c≤N and a+b=c.
Two tuples are considered different if they differ in at least one position. Given N, find the number of good tuples that can be formed by integers from 1 to N.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The following T lines contain a single integer N.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of good tuples which can be formed using integers from 1 to N.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤N≤106

Explanation
Example case 1: There are no good tuples. (1,2,3) is not a good tuple since 1 is not prime.
Example case 2: (2,3,5) is a good tuple since 2, 3 and 5 are prime and 2+3=5.
