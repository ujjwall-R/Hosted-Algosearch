Chef has two sequences A and B, each with length N. He can apply the following magic operation an arbitrary number of times (including zero): choose an index i (1≤i≤N−2) and add 1 to Ai, 2 to Ai+1 and 3 to Ai+2, i.e. change Ai to Ai+1, Ai+1 to Ai+1+2 and Ai+2 to Ai+2+3.
Chef asks you to tell him if it is possible to obtain sequence B from sequence A this way. Help him!
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N. 
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
The third line contains N space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "TAK" if it is possible to reach sequence B or "NIE" otherwise.
Constraints

1≤T≤1,000
1≤N≤105
0≤Ai≤108 for each valid i
0≤Bi≤108 for each valid i
the sum of N for all test cases does not exceed 5⋅105

Example Input
2
5
0 0 0 0 0 
1 2 4 2 3
5
0 0 0 0 0 
1 2 4 2 4

Example Output
TAK
NIE

Explanation
Example case 1: Chef can apply the operation at index i=3 and get the sequence (0,0,1,2,3). Afterwards, he can apply that operation at index i=1 and get the sequence (1,2,4,2,3)=B.
Example case 2: It is impossible to reach sequence B.
