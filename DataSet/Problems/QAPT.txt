AliceAlice and BobBob were fond of playing. One day, AliceAlice came up with a game of power of two. The game is as follows:

Alice starts the game.
Bob gives Alice a number.
If the number is a power of 2, divide it by 2 and change the turn, else subtract the highest power of 2 and change the turn.
Continue until 1 is left.

The person who cannot move further loses the game.

Input:
-The first line of each input consists of a test case t.
-In every line of the t lines that follow, is given a number n.

Output:
-Output "Alice" if Alice is a winner, else output "Bob".

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 2^64 - 1
1 <= t <= 10

Sample Input:
2
1
6

Sample Output:
Bob
Bob

Explanation :
In the first case, since n is already 1, Alice doesn't get a chance to play the game. Hence he loses.
In the second case, Alice subtracts the highest power of 2 less than 6, which is 4 and gives it to Bob. Now Bob divides this by 2 since it is a perfect power of 2. Since the number has become equal to 1, hence Bob wins the game.
