Shaun is very much interested in Subarrays. Shaun wants to count the number of subarrays in his chosen array with sum being a multiple of 109109. Since, Shaun is interested in huge numbers.He chose his array such that it contains only 108108 and 9∗1089∗108 as its elements.
Help shaun to count the number of required subarrays.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
First line of each testcase contains one integer N,size of array A. 
Second line of each testcase contains N space separated array elements

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line number of subarrays with sum being multiple of 109.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤N≤105
A[i]=108 , 9∗108

Sample Input:
   2
   3
   100000000 900000000 100000000
   1
   900000000

Sample Output:
