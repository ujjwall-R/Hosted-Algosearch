The jury has a secret number N, where 1≤N≤1018. You want to know this number, and you are allowed to ask the jury some queries. In each query, you give the jury a number X where 0≤X≤2⋅1018, and the jury tells you XmodN.
Please find N using at most two queries per test case.
Interaction Format

The first line of contains T - the number of test cases.
For each test case, you are allowed to allowed to ask the jury at most two queries. To make a query, output ? X on one line; the jury will return the value of xmodN to the input for you to read.
In the case you exceed the number of queries, the judge will exit with the Wrong Answer verdict.
Once you have found the answer, output ! N on one line. This does not count as a query. 
If you output the wrong value for N, the judge will exit with the Wrong Answer verdict; if you output the correct value for N, the judge will silently continues. This means you should start asking queries for the next test case right after outputting the value of N for the previous test case.

Explanation

Test case 1: Jury's secret number is N=6. Your first query is X=5, so the jury returns 5mod6=5. Your second query is X=6, so the jury returns 6mod6=0. Finally, you output 6 as the final answer, which is the correct answer.
Test case 2: Jury's secret number is N=39. Your first query is X=4, so the jury returns 4mod39=4. Your second query is X=5, so the jury returns 5mod39=5. Finally, you output 39 as the final answer, which is the correct answer (but a completely wild guess).

Note that the jury does not output anything other than the answers to the queries, so please start asking queries for the next test case after outputting N for the previous test case.
