You are given a sequence A1,A2,…,AN which contains pairwise distinct elements and a sequence B1,B2,…,BN, which also contains pairwise distinct elements (but not necessarily distinct from elements of A). For each valid i, 1≤Ai,Bi≤2⋅N.
You may rotate B as many times as you want. A rotation consists of moving the first element of the sequence to the end. Afterwards, let's define a sequence C1,C2,…,CN as Ci=(Ai+Bi)%N for each valid i.
There are N possible sequences C. Find the lexicographically smallest of these sequences.
Note: A sequence x is lexicographically smaller than a different sequence y if xi < yi, where i is the smallest valid index where the sequences x and y differ.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN. 
The third line contains N space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BN. 

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers C1,C2,…,CN denoting the lexicographically smallest sequence.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤N≤105
1≤Ai,Bi≤2⋅N for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105

1 2 0


Explanation
Example case 1: After rotating B once, it becomes (3,4,1). Now C=(1,2,0). This is the lexicographically smallest of all possible sequences C.
