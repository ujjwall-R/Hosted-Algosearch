 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
Statement
You will be given an array A of N integers. You need to answer M queries.
Each query is of the form G x y.
For each query, construct the set S from A. A[i] is included in S if x <= i <= y and GCD(G,A[i]) > 1.
Let MAX be the maximum number present in S. Output MAX and number of occurances of MAX in S. If no such number exists, output "-1 -1" (without quotes).

Input
The first line of the input contains 2 integers N and M.
Next line has N integers representing the elements of array A.
M lines follow, one per query. Each line has 3 integers G, x and y
Output
For each query output the required Answer.

Constraints
1 ≤ N,M,G,A[i] ≤ 100000  (1 ≤ i ≤ N)
1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ N
 

                        Sample Input 1
                        





6 5
1 2 3 4 5 4
2 1 5
121 1 6
3 2 6
5 5 5
24 4 6



                        Sample Output 1
                        





4 1
-1 -1
3 1
5 1
4 2


Explanation
Query #1
GCD(2,1)=1, GCD(2,2)=2, GCD(2,3)=1, GCD(2,4)=2, GCD(2,5)=1
S = {2,4}
MAX = 4Query #2
S = {}
There is no element in A such that GCD(121, A[i])>1Query #5
GCD(24,4)=4, GCD(24,5)=1, GCD(24,4)=4
S = {4,4}
MAX = 4
Answer is "4 2" as there are 2 occurances of 4 in S
