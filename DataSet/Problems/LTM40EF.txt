Chef likes problems related to learning new languages. He only knows first N letters of English alphabet. Also he explores all M-letter words formed by the characters he knows. Define cost for a given M-letter word S, cost(S) = P1, S1+P2, S2+...+PM, SM, where Pi, j is i, jth entry of matrix P. Sort all the words by descending cost, if costs are equal, sort them lexicographically. You need to find K-th M-letter word in Chef's order.

Input
First line contains three positive integer numbers N, M and K.
Next M lines contains N integers per line, denoting the matrix P.
Output
Output in a single line K-th M-letter in Chef's order.
