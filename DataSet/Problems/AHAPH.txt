Ansh and Parth love playing games with arrays. But unfortunately, Parth never succeeds to beat Ansh. But this time Parth came up with a new game which he expects Ansh to lose.
Ansh has to find the number of ways to construct  an array such that every consecutive element in the array has a different value. Also every element in the array should be in the range [L,R][L,R] (both inclusive). Apart from these, Parth also need the elements with index ii and j to be integers X and Y respectively, where i and j lies in the range [1,N] while X and Y lies in the range [L,R] as stated above.
It is guaranteed that if j = i+1 then X and Y are different.
Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then each testcase follow two lines.
First line of each testcase contains three space - separated integers : N,L,R denoting size of array, lower and upper range of integers to be filled respectively.
Second line contains four space-separated integers i,X,j,Y denoting first index, element in index i, second index and element in index j respectively.

Output:
For each testcase, output one integer, the number of ways to fill the array. Since the answer may be large, find it modulo 109+7.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
3≤N≤5∗108
1≤L,R,X,Y≤109
1≤i<j≤N
L≤X,Y≤R

Sample Input:
3
3 1 5
1 1 3 2
4 1 5
2 1 4 1
10000000 1 1000000000
4 2 5 3

Sample Output:
3
16
980839842

EXPLANATION:
Sample testcase 1: All possible arrays are: [1,3,2], [1,4,2] and [1,5,2].
So, the number of ways to fill the array is 3.
