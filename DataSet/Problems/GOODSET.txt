A set of integers is called good if there does not exist three distinct elements a, b, c in it such that a + b = c.
Your task is simple. Just output any good set of n integers. All the elements in this set should be distinct and should lie between 1 and 500, both inclusive.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases. The descriptions of T test cases follow.
The only line of each test case contains an integer n, denoting the size of the needed good set.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing n integers denoting the elements of the good set, in any order. There can be more than one possible good set, and you can output any one of them.
Constraints
1 ≤ T, n ≤ 100
Subtasks
Subtask #1 (50 points): 1 ≤ T, n ≤ 10
Subtask #2 (50 points): original constraints

Explanation
Example 1 and 2. Any set of size less than or equal to 2 is good by definition.
Example 3 onwards. For each pair of elements in the set, you can see that their sum doesn't exist in the set.
