Ada has a set of N non-negative integers S={x1,x2,…,xN}. She defined the function W as follows:

W({})=0.
If S={a}, then W(S)=a.
If S={a,b} (so |S|=2), then W(S)=(a⊕b)−1.
If |S|≥3, then to calculate W(S), find any two elements of S that are congruent (have the same remainders) modulo the highest possible power of 2 (the highest power for which such a pair exists). Let's denote them by a and b. Then W(S)=W({a,b})⊕W(S∖{a,b}).
It is guaranteed that W(S) is well-defined, i.e. does not depend on the exact choice of the two congruent elements.

Here, ⊕ represents the binary XOR operation and A∖B represents set difference.
Ada needs to calculate the function W for each set that is created by removing exactly one element from S. Formally, she wants to find W(S∖{xi}) for each valid i. Can you help her?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The next line contains N space-separated integers x1,x2,…,xN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers. For each valid i, the i-th of these integers should denote W(S∖{xi}).
Constraints

1≤T≤106
1≤N≤105
0≤xi≤1018 for each valid i
x1,x2,…,xN are pairwise distinct
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106
