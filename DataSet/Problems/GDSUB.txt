Chef is given a sequence of prime numbers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. This sequence has exactly 2N2N subsequences. A subsequence of AA is good if it does not contain any two identical numbers; in particular, the empty sequence is good.
Chef has to find the number of good subsequences which contain at most K numbers. Since he does not know much about subsequences, help him find the answer. This number could be very large, so compute it modulo 1,000,000,007.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer ― the number of good subsequences with size at most K, modulo 1,000,000,007.
Constraints

1≤K≤N≤105
2≤Ai≤8,000 for each valid i

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (40 points): A1,A2,…,AN are pairwise distinct
Subtask #2 (60 points): original constraints

Explanation
There is 1 good subsequence with length 0, 5 good subsequences with length 1, 8 good subsequences with length 2 and 4 good subsequences with length 3.
