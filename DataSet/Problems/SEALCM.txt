 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.

In this problem Sereja is interested in number of arrays A[1], A[2], ..., A[N] (1 ≤ A[i] ≤ M, A[i] - integer) 
such that least common multiple (LCM) of all its elements is divisible by number D. 


Please, find sum of answers to the problem with D = L, D = L+1, ..., D = R. As answer could be large, please output it modulo 
(109 + 7).

Input
First line of input contain integer T - number of test cases. 
For each test case, only line of input contain four integers N, M, L, R.
Output
For each test case, output required sum modulo (109 + 7).

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 5*106
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ M ≤ 1000

Subtasks

Subtask #1: 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10 (25 points)
Subtask #2: 1 ≤ N, M ≤  1000  (25 points)
Subtask #3: original constraints (50 points)

Example
Input:
2
5 5 1 5
5 5 4 5

Output:
12310
4202
