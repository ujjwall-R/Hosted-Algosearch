A permutation of length NN is an array of NN integers (P1,P2,…,PN)(P1,P2,…,PN) where every integer from 1 to N (inclusive) appears in it exactly once. The weight of a subsegment containing the elements (Pl,Pl+1,…,Pr) is defined as follows:  W(l,r)=(r−l+1)⋅minl≤i≤r(Pi)
 where 1≤l≤r≤N and minl≤i≤r(Pi) denotes the minimum element of the subsegment.
You are given two integers N and X. You need to determine if there exists a permutation of length N such that it contains at least one subsegment having weight X?
Input Format

The first line contains an integer T - the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N,X - the length of the permutation and the weight parameter mentioned in the question respectively.

Output Format
For each test case, print YES if there exists a permutation of length N having at least one subsegment with a weight of X, otherwise print NO.
You may print each character of Yes and No in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, YES will be considered identical).
Constraints

1≤T≤104
1≤N≤105
1≤X≤1010
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅105.

Explanation
Test case 1: [1,2,3] is one of the valid permutations because it contains the following subsegment having weight 2. 
W(1,2)=(2−1+1)⋅min1≤i≤2(Pi)=2⋅1=2 
Test case 2: It can be proven that there does not exist any permutation of length 3 which has a subsegment having weight 5.
Test case 3: [4,2,1,3,5] is one of the valid permutations because it contains the following subsegment having weight 6.
W(4,5)=(5−4+1)⋅min4≤i≤5(Pi)=2⋅3=6
