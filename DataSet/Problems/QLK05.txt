Ram has decided to create a new advanced programming language.
He decides that he shall call it Hajube!
Now he knows that if he wants the other programmers to use his language , he must make his language as useful as possible!
So he decides to go to Satyabrat for advice. 
Satyabrat being a smart guy, immediately gives him a list of NN features that will make Hajube useful and also gave him a formula!
The formula is simple enough : 
If Ram succesfully implements NN features , the usefulness score of Hajube will become NNNN .
Now to make his language popular he needs at-least K usefulness score.
Now as Ram is weak in mathematics, you have to tell him whether his language will be popular or not!

Input:

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains of a single line of input having two integers N denoting the number of features given , and K denoting the number of features given and the minimum usefulness score required to make the language popular.


Output:
For each testcase, print in a single line "Yes" if the language will become successful otherwise print "No".

Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤N,K≤1018


Sample Input:
2
1 1
2 5

Sample Output:
Yes
No

EXPLANATION:
The usefulness score of the language in first case is 1 which is equal to the given K.
    So the answer is Yes.
The usefulness score of the language in second case is 4 which is less than the given K.
     So the answer is No.
