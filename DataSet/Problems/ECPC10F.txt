You have given an array of NN integers as AA = { A1,A2,A3,.......ANA1,A2,A3,.......AN }          
You need to process Q queries
Each query consist of 3 integers L,R,K and described below                 
L R K: Find Largest K numbers between L and R . Lets call it as B1,B2,B3,......BK
Find Value of below equation
B1 ^ B2 ^ B3 ^……   ^BK
Here  ^ denotes bitwise xor.
Input:

First line will contain a single integer N
Next Line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,....AN.        
Next line will contain a single integer Q
Next Q Lines contains 3 space separated integers L,R,K.

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line answer to given query.
Constraints

2≤N,Q≤105
1≤Ai≤109 
1≤L≤R≤N 
1≤K≤R−L+1

Sample Input:
3

1 2 3
1
1 3  2
Sample Output:
1

EXPLANATION:
A = [ 1,2,3]
Largest 2 integers between (1,3) are 2,3
So
B = [2,3] = 2^3 = 1
