Chefina likes prefix and suffix sums, so Chef decided to give some to her as her birthday present. He created a sequence a1,a2,…,aN and calculated its prefix sums pre1,pre2,…,preN (for each valid i, prei is the sum of the first i elements of a) and suffix sums suf1,suf2,…,sufN (for each valid i, sufi is the sum of the last i elements of a). He arranged the elements of these sequences in a gift box and went to Chefina's home.
When Chefina opened the gift box, she found out that all the elements got shuffled when Chef was carrying the box. For each element, it is now impossible to determine if it belonged to the sequence pre or suf and what its index in the correct sequence was. The only thing we know is a sequence x1,x2,…,x2N, which contains all the elements of the sequences pre and suf, in no particular order.
Chefina is now curious about the number of initial sequences a which Chef could have chosen, such that it is possible to obtain x by shuffling the prefix and suffix sums of a. Help Chefina find this number. Since it could be very large, compute it modulo 1,000,000,007.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains 2N space-separated integers x1,x2,…,x2N.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of possible initial sequences modulo 1,000,000,007.
Constraints
