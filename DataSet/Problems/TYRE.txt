Explanation
Test Case 1: There are 2 bikes and 1 car. Each bike has 2 tyres, so there are 2⋅2=4 bike tyres. Similarly, each car has 4 tyres, so there are 1⋅4=4 car tyres. Adding the tyres of all vehicles, we get 4+4=8 tyres in total.
Test Case 2: There are 3 bikes and 0 cars. Each bike has 2 tyres, so there are 3⋅2=6 bike tyres. There are no cars, so there are 0⋅4=0 car tyres. Adding the tyres of all vehicles, we get 6+0=6 tyres in total.
