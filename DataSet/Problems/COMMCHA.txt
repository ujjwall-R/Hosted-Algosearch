There is a communication channel with N+1 stations (numbered 0 through N). Station 0 wants to send a message to station N. You may install memory disks at up to K of the stations 1,2,…,N−1. Let's denote the increasing sequence of stations at which memory disks are installed by (v1,v2,…,vk), where k≤K is the number of such stations, and let v0=0 and vk+1=N. In stations other than v0,v1,…,vk+1, it is only possible to send the message forward without storing it for later.
For each i (0≤i<N), if the message is currently at the station i, this station can send the message to the station i+1. This transfer takes one second regardless of its success or failure. With probability pi, the transfer succeeds and the message reaches the station i+1. Otherwise, the transfer fails and the message instantly goes back to the station vj, where j is the unique index such that vj≤i<vj+1 (if i=vj, the message simply stays in the station vj), and this station has to send it forward again.
Your task is to choose stations where memory disks should be installed, in such a way that the expected value of time needed for the message to reach station N is the smallest possible. Find this smallest expected time.
You are not given the probabilities directly. Instead, you are given a non-increasing integer sequence F0,F1,…,FN. For each valid i, pi=Fi+1/Fi.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N+1 space-separated integers F0,F1,…,FN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one real number — the smallest possible expected time needed for the message to reach station N. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10−6.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤N≤105
0≤K≤min(50,N−1)
1012≥F0≥F1≥…≥FN≥1
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105

Example Input
1
2 1
4 2 1

Example Output
4.0000000000

Explanation
Example case 1: The probabilities of success are p0=p1=1/2. If no memory disks are installed, the expected amount of time the message needs to reach station 2 is 6 seconds.
If a memory disk is installed at station 1, the expected time is 4 seconds (2 seconds to transfer from station 0 to station 1 and further 2 seconds to transfer from station 1 to station 2).
