Chef has invented 11-minute Instant Noodles. As the name suggests, each packet takes exactly 11 minute to cook.
Chef's restaurant has X stoves and only 1 packet can be cooked in a single pan. 
How many customers can Chef serve in Y minutes if each customer orders exactly 1 packet of noodles?
Input Format

The first and only line of input contains two space-separated integers X and Y — the number of stoves and the number of minutes, respectively.

Output Format

Print a single integer, the maximum number of customers Chef can serve in Y minutes

Constraints

1≤X,Y≤1000


                        Sample Input 1
                        





3 7



                        Sample Output 1
                        





21


Explanation
Chef cooks for Y=7 minutes and can cook X=3 packets per minute, one on each stove.
So, the total number of packets that can be cooked is X⋅Y=3⋅7=21. 
Each person orders one packet, so the maximum number of customers that can be served is 21.

                        Sample Input 2
                        





7 8



                        Sample Output 2
                        





56


Explanation
Chef cooks for Y=8 minutes and can cook X=7 packets per minute, one on each stove.
So, the total number of packets that can be cooked is X⋅Y=7⋅8=56. 
Each person orders one packet, so the maximum number of customers that can be served is 56.
