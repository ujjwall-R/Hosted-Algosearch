These particle are quite familiar among quantum scientists. One such scientist Dr. Rakesh Yadav need to place E electrons in a magnetic field for his experiment. After a long painstaking calculation he found N feasible coordinates along the x-axis. But to minimize the repelling force among electrons he wants to place the electrons, such that the minimum distance between any two of them is as large as possible. This is again a vast calculation. So he wants you to help him find the largest minimum distance.

 
Input
The first lint contains T,the number of test cases.
The first line of each test cases contains two space separated integers, N and E.
The subsequent line contain N space separated integers x1,x2,x3....denoting feasible position


 
Output
For each test case output one integer: the largest minimum distance
Constraints
1 ≤ T≤ 100,000 
2 ≤ N≤ 100,000 
2 ≤ E≤ N 
1 ≤ xi≤ 1,000,000,000
 
Example
Input:

1 
5 3 
1 2 8 4 9



Output:

3

 
Explanation
Example case 1.

We can put electrons in position 1,4,8 resulting in minimum distance 3
