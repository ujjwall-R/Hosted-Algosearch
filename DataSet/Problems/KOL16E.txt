There are some short-cut ways to check divisibility of numbers in base 10. Here are some examples:

Remember divisibility testing of 3 in base 10? It was simple, right? We need to add all the digits and then check if it is divisible by 3. Call this method "1-sum".
In case of testing of 11, we need to add all digits by alternating their signs. For example, 1354379988104 = 11*123125453464 and (4-0+1-8+8-9+9-7+3-4+5-3+1) = 0, which is divisible by 11 (0 = 0*11).  Lets call this method "1-altersum".
In case of 7, we need to add all 3-digit-groups by alternating their signs. For example,  8618727529993 = 7*1231246789999 and (993-529+727-618+8) = 581, which is divisible by 7 (581 = 7*83). Similarly, we call this method "3-altersum".
In similar Manner, 13’s checking is "3-altersum".

In this problem, we are interested to see divisibility checking of only prime numbers in base 10. For a prime P, you need to find the smallest positive integer N such that P’s divisibility testing is "N-sum" or "N-altersum".
Input
At first you will be given T (T ≤ 1000), the number of test cases. Then T lines will follow. In each line there will be single integer P (P ≤ 231-1 = 2147483647), the prime number (P is a prime number NOT equal to 2 or 5).
Output
For each line of input, produce exactly one line of output like either "Case <test-case>: <N>-sum" or "Case <test-case>: <N>-altersum". Please see sample input and output for details.
Sample Input
