Today, you finally have a chance to compete with a famous coder like Chef and prove your mettle.
Chef has n distinct points in 2-D plane, i.e. there are never two points with both x and y coordinate equal and there are no two points with same x coordinate. Consider a subset of above n points which can be arranged as a sequence p1,..pk, such that xp1< xp2 < ...< xpk and each point pi, where i is in range between 3 and k (both inclusive) lies below or on the line passing between points pi-1 and pi-2. Chef likes these kind of subsets. So he wants to find the size of largest of such subsets. 
Input
First line of the input contains one integer T - number of tests. T tests follows.
First line of each test contains one integer N - number of points.
The next N lines of each test case contain integer point coordinates xi, yi.
Output
For a each test case, output a single integer in separate line corresponding to the largest subset size.
Constraints

1 ≤ T, N, sum over all N over all test cases ≤ 2000
1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 109

Example
 Input:
 3
 3
 1 1
 4 2
 9 3
 4
 1 1
 4 2
 5 2
 9 3
 4
 2 3
 4 1
 1 2
 3 2

 Output:
 3
 3
 4

Explanation
Explanation case 1. We can get sequence (1, 1) - (4, 2) - (9, 3), point (9, 3) lies below line between point (1, 1) and (4, 2).
Explanation case 2. We can get (1, 1) -(4, 2) - (9, 3)
Explanation case 3. We can get (1, 2) -(2, 3) - (3, 2) - (4, 1)
