Chef Leonardo has a decimal integer NN and a non-zero decimal digit dd. NN does not contain the digit zero; specifically, N should always be treated as a decimal integer without leading zeroes.
Chef likes d and does not like any other digit, so he decided to change N. He may apply the following operation any number of times (including zero): append the digit d to the decimal representation of N (d becomes the least significant digit of N), then remove one occurrence of one digit from the decimal representation of N.
Chef has already changed a lot of numbers and he got bored. Now, he wants to know the smallest possible value of N which can be obtained by performing the operation described above. Can you help him?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and d.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the minimum number Chef can obtain.
Constraints

34
24
24


Explanation
Example case 1: Chef can remove the digit 5 and add 4 to the end of N. Then, N becomes 34.
Example case 2: Chef can remove the digit 4 from the beginning of N, add 4 to the end of N and get N=24.
Example case 3: Chef cannot make his number any smaller.
