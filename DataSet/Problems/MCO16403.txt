Flippy the bird has a tree with NN nodes. Each edge has a weight wiwi. We can choose one of the vertices as the root of the tree, say r. Then, the height of the node u would be the sum of the weights on the path from r to u.
Suppose we take the node u as the root. What is the sum of the heights of all nodes? Answer this question for all possible nodes u.
Input

The first line contains a single integer N, the number of nodes of the tree.
The next n−1 lines contain three space-separated integers, u, v, w, denoting the endpoints of the edge and the weight of the edge respectively.

Output
Output n space-separated integers. The ith integer denotes the sum of heights of all vertices if node i is chosen as root.
Constraints

2≤n≤3⋅105
1≤wi≤108

Subtasks
Subtask 1 (28 points): 2≤n≤5000

Example Input
4
1 2 3
2 3 5
2 4 6

Example Output
20 14 24 26

Explanation
The heights of the nodes when the root is 1 are 0, 3, 8, 9 respectively. So, the sum is 0+3+8+9=20. Similarly, you can calculate this value for the case when other nodes are chosen as root as well.
