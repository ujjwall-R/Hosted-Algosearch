You are given an integer sequence A1,A2,…,AN and integers K and M. For 1≤i≤j≤N, let's define S(i,j) as the number of ways to choose exactly K elements of the contiguous subsequence Ai,Ai+1,…,Aj in such a way that the median of these K elements is ≥M.
Find the sum of S(i,j) over all i,j such that 1≤i≤j≤N. Since this sum may be large, calculate it modulo 109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers N, K and M.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer — ∑Ni=1∑Nj=iS(i,j) modulo 109+7.
Constraints

1≤N≤105
3≤K≤100
K is an odd number
1≤M≤200
1≤Ai≤109 for each valid i
all elements of A are pairwise distinct
