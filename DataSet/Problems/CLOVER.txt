Now you are given q queries such that each query consists of a vertex number. For each query you need to answer the following (let the vertex given in a query be v):
Let us consider the path from root of the tree to vertex v. Now you need to find a vertex in this path which has a value greater than or equal to “value[v]-value[0]”. If there are many such vertices then you need to find the vertex closest to the given vertex (i.e. v) and if there is no such vertex then return “-1”.
*NOTE: It’s is given that the root is assigned the least value of the tree such that “value[v]-value[0]” is always positive. 
Also it is given that the queries does not  contain the root vertex.

 
Input
First line contains two integer n and q. Next line contains n spaced integers specifying the value assigned to each vertex. This follows with the next n-1 lines which describes the edges of the tree. Finally q lines follow which represents the queries where each line consists of an integer representing the vertex for which the query is to be answered.
 
Output
It consists of q lines where each line contains two integers one representing the vertex number and the other representing the value corresponding to that vertex.Also if no such vertex exists output “-1” for that query.
 
Constraints

2 ≤ n ≤ 100000
0 ≤ x ≤ 100000
1 ≤ q ≤ 1000000
