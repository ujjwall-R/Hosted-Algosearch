Danya has a sequence AA of non-negative integers. Initially, AA has length NN.
Let's define a function f(x,A)f(x,A), where xx is a positive integer ≤|A|≤|A|, as the maximum of bitwise ANDs of all subsequences of AA with length equal to xx.
Kostya gives Danya MM requests. There are three types of requests:

1v1v: append an integer vv to AA
2v2v: delete an element equal to vv from AA; it is guaranteed that AA contains vv at least once, but if there are more elements equal to vv, you should only delete one of them
3x3x: calculate f(x,A)f(x,A)

Also, Kostya knows that at any time, all elements of AA are smaller than 2k2k for a fixed kk.
Help Danya process all of Kostya's requests.
Input

The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers NN, MM and kk.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers a1,a2,…,aNa1,a2,…,aN denoting the initial sequence AA.
Each of the following MM lines contains two space-separated integers describing a request in the format 1v1v, 2v2v or 3x3x.

Output
For each request of type 3, print a single line containing one integer — the value of f(x,A)f(x,A).

Explanation
Subsequences giving optimal answers for the requests of type 3 are, in order: (6,7)(6,7); (6,7,5)(6,7,5); (6,7,7)(6,7,7); (7,5)(7,5).
