Given a string S consisting of only 1s and 0s, find the number of substrings which start and end both in 1.
In this problem, a substring is defined as a sequence of continuous characters Si, Si+1, ..., Sj where 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ N.

Input
First line contains T, the number of testcases. Each testcase consists of N(the length of string) in one line and string in second line.
Output
For each testcase, print the required answer in one line.
Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 105
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
Sum of  N  over all testcases ≤ 105

Explanation
Test case 11: All substrings of this string start and end with 1. The substrings are {1,1,1,1,11,11,11,111,111,1111}{1,1,1,1,11,11,11,111,111,1111}. The total count of these substrings is 10.
Test case 2: Three substrings of this string start and end with 1. These are {1,1,10001}.
