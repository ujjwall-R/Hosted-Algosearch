Chef and his wife Chefina started playing a new game.
At the beginning of the game, Chefina secretly writes down a matrix A with N rows (numbered 1 through N) and N columns (numbered 1 through N). All elements of this matrix are distinct positive integers. Then, Chefina asks Chef to find the position (row and column) of the element with value V, or determine that such an element does not occur in A. Chef does not know the matrix A, but he can ask Chefina at most K questions about it. Each question must be in the format 1rc; Chefina answers Chef with the number Ar,c.
Since this task is really hard for Chef, Chefina decided to give him additional help — she told Chef that the matrix she writes down has a special property: each row and each column is sorted in some order (descending or ascending). Different rows and columns may be sorted in different order.
Chef may ask at most K questions in the format above. Afterwards, he must tell Chefina the position of the element V in the format 2ij, with the meaning that Ai,j=V if V occurs in A, or with i=j=−1 if V does not occur in A.
This is an interactive problem. You should play the game for Chef; the grader plays for Chefina.
Input
The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers N, K and V.
Interaction
To ask a question, print one line containing three space-separated integers 1, r and c to the output. Then, read the answer to this question from the input. The answer for an invalid question is −1.
You may ask at most K questions. Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!
Finally, print the answer as one line containing three space-separated integers 2, i and j.
