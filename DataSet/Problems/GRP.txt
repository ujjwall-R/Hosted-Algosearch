Consider an array A of size N which only contains 1s and 0s. Let's define 'Group' as the subarray containing only 0s or only 1s. You are also given two values x and y. Your task is to flip the values (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0) in the array such that length of every 'Group' is between x and y (inclusive). But thats not it :p. You are also given another array B of size N which consists of the cost of flipping the respective values of array A. Formally, for each position i from 1 to N ,the cost of flipping the value of Ai is Bi. You need to find the minimum cost such that the resultant array A′ satisfy the given condition. 
Note: It is possible that answer does not exist. In that case print -1.


Input
First line contains T denoting number of test cases.Next line consists of N denoting the size of the arrays. Next line contains x and y as described in the problem.Following line consists of N space separated integers of array A where elements can be 0 or 1. Next line consists of N space separated integers of array B, cost of flipping the values at ith position.
Output
If answer exists, print overall minimum cost else print -1 (in new line).
Constraints

1 <= T <= 70
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= x <= y <= N
Ai can be 0 or 1
0 <= Bi <= 1000

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (15 points):

1 <= N <= 15
Subtask #2 (85 points):

1 <= N <= 1000
Example
Input:
1
5
2 3
0 1 0 1 0
10 5 11 4 1

Output:
6

Explanation
Example case 1. The resultant array is [0,0,0,1,1] and the overall minimum cost is 6.
