Little Harry is very sad that he is not able to meet his friends during the quarantine. So, to make Harry happy his uncle Sirius gives him chocolates for the next N number of days. Harry finishes eating the chocolates he has received on a particular day, on the same day itself. But uncle Sirius is also concerned that Harry might eat too many chocolates, so he has asked for your help.

Here’s how you can help:
You are given the number of chocolates Harry receives each day for N number of days starting from the very first day. Now you are given Q queries, in each query Uncle Sirius asks you the number of days Harry has taken to eat M chocolates in total. 
(Please note that each query contains a different number of M.)

Input:

First-line contains N and Q  , the number of days and the number of queries. 
Second-line contains N integers, in which ith integer denotes the number of chocolates Harry has eaten on an ith day.
Then the next line contains Q space-separated integers, M, where ith M denotes the ith query, i.e., the number of chocolates.

Output:
For each of the Q queries, you have to output the number of days Harry has taken to eat M chocolates in a new line.
