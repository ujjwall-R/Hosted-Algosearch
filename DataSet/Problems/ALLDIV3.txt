Chef has an array AA of length NN.
Since Chef's favorite number is 33, he wants to make all numbers in the array a multiple of 3.
Chef can do the following operation:

Select any 2 different indices i and j and increase Ai by 1 and decrease Aj by 1.

Help Chef find out the minimum number of operations required (or report its not possible) to achieve his objective.
Input Format

The first line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains N, denoting the length of the array.
The second line of each testcase contains N space separated integers Ai.

Output Format
Output the minimum number of operations required to make all numbers divisible by 3.
If it is not possible to make every number divisible by 3, then output −1.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
2≤N≤105
1≤Ai≤109
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105

Explanation
Test Case 1: Chef can select the indices 2 and 1 and thus increase A2 by 1 and decrease A1 by 1. Thus the array becomes [0,3,3]. So every number is now divisible by 3.
Test Case 2: Since all the numbers are already multiples of 3, Chef will not need to apply the operation at all.
Test Case 3: There is no way to make all the numbers a multiple of 3.
