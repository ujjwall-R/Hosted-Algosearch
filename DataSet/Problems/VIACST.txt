The rail system in Mumbai has changed. Now, you can buy a ticket from a station, and go to another station, if there are exactly K tracks on the route, and the route passes through a particular station. You are given N, the number of stations in Mumbai. The number M denotes how many tracks there are in the system. You are also given M pairs of integers, Ai and Bi, denoting that there is a track from Ai to Bi. Now, Dipen is from Jalgaon and hence, wants to know in how many ways, he can get from city X to city Z via city Y if he has a ticket that allows for exactly K tracks in all. Can you help him out?
Note:Trains can run in only one direction on a track, from Ai to Bi.
Input:

First line contains T.  T testcases follow.
The first line of each testcase contain the integers N and M.
M lines follow, containing Ai and Bi.
The last line of the testcase contains X, Y, Z and K.


Output:
For each testcase, output the required answer.


Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100000
1 <= N <=105
1 <= M <= (N*(N+1))/2
1 <=  Ai, Bi, X, Y, Z <= N
1 <= K <= M
1 <= Sum of N over all testcases <= 106

Example:
Input:
2
4 4
1 2
1 3
2 3
3 4
1 3 4 2
5 6
1 2
1 3
1 4
2 3
4 3
