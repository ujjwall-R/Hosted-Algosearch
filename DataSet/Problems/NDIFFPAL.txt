A palindrome is a string that reads same in both directions: forwards and backwards. For example, the strings radar and noon are palindromes, whereas the string chef is not a palindrome as being read backwards is becomes equal to fehc, which is not equal to chef.
Let's say that the pair of indices (i, j) denotes a palindrome in some string S iff i ≤ j and the substring starting at the i-th character and ending at the j-th character of S is a palindrome.
Given an integer N. Your task is to construct a string S such that there are exactly N different pairs (i, j) that denotes a palindrome.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the sought number of pairs that denote palindrome. 
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing a string S, consisting of lowecase Latin letters, and having exactly N distinct palindrome-denoting pairs. If there's a few such strings, output any one.
If such string S doesn't exist, output -1 instead of it.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 104

Example
Input:
3
6
7
2

Output:
noon
radar
ab
Explanation
Example case 1. In the string "noon", the pairs that denote a palindrome are (1-indexed): (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 4).
Example case 2. In the string "radar", the pairs that denote a palindrome are (1-indexed): (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5).
Example case 3. In the string "ab", the pairs denoting a palindrome are : (1, 1), (2, 2)
