Chef is eager to celebrate diwali. But he is assigned the task to distribute sweets to his neighbours. Consider Chef's neighbour live on a number line starting from 1. Chef doesn't like some of his neighbours. More specifically, he has NN neighbours which he doesn't like, given by A1,A2,...ANA1,A2,...AN.
Chef decides that he will exclude these neighbours while distrubing sweets. As it is tedious task, he decides that he will deliver sweets to kk-th nearest neighbours. You are given Q queries, each query contains a number positive number K, help Chef to determine the k-th nearest neighbour.   
Input Format

The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N,Q, number of integers, number of queries.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,...,AN.
Then Q lines follows containing a single integer K in each line.

Output Format
Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain the response to the i-th query.
Constraints

1≤N,Q≤105
1≤A1<A2<...<AN≤109
1≤Ki≤1018
All values in input are integers

Explanation
The positive integers that differ from all of A1,A2,...AN are 1,2,4,8,9,10,11,… in ascending order. The second, fifth, and third smallest of them are 2, 9, and 4, respectively.
