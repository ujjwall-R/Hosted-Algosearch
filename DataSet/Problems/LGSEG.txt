Chef has a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. Let's call a contiguous subsequence of AA a segment.
A segment is good if it can be divided into at most KK segments such that the sum of elements in each of these sub-segments is at most S.
You need to find the maximum number of elements in a good segment.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, K and S.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum length of a good segment.
Constraints

1≤T≤150,000
1≤K≤N≤105
1≤S≤109
1≤Ai≤S for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106

Explanation
Example case 1: One of the segments with length 4 is [1,3,2,1]. It can be divided into two segments [1,3] and [2,1] whose sums are at most S=5.
