Given two positive numbers BB and CC, what is the minimum positive value of AA, such that A⋅B is divisible by C.
Here, A⋅B denotes the value obtained when A is multiplied by B. 
Input Format

The first line will contain an integer T - number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers B and C.

Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum value of A such that A⋅B is divisible by C. 
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤B,C≤109


                        Sample Input 1

3


Explanation
Test case 1: We have B=2 and C=4. If we choose A=2, then A⋅B=4, which is divisible by 4. Note that this is minimum positive value of A, such that A⋅B is divisible by C.
Test case 2: We have B=8 and C=12. If we choose A=3, then A⋅B=24, which is divisible by 12. Note that this is minimum positive value of A, such that A⋅B is divisible by C.
