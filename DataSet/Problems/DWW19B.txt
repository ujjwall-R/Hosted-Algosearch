Krishna loves visiting coffee shop in search of finding a date for himself. It's been years now since he started visiting the coffee shop, but no luck till now. But that doesn't mean he'll stop trying. He visits the coffee shop on a regular basis, at every KK units of time. This means that his visits in the coffee shop happen at time K,2K,3K,…K,2K,3K,… respectively. The main problem is that he doesn't know anything about the girls visiting the coffee shop, maybe that's why he's been so lonely all these years.
A total of NN girls visit the coffee shop on a regular basis, and for each valid i, the ith girl visits the coffee shop at every Ai units of time. Out of the N girls, only one girl needs to be selected. Now, pitying upon his situation, you've decided to tell him the minimum amount of time that he'll have to wait to meet a girl in the coffee shop, just to keep his hope alive. Waiting time is the total time elapsed. For example, if there is a girl who visits the coffee shop every 3 units of time, and Krishna visits at every 2 units of time, then Krishna can meet the girl at his 12th visit (it would be the girl's 8th visit). In this case the wait time is 24 units. You need to find a suitable girl and minimize the wait time.
Can you do that for him?
Note: Assume that time is discrete, and if Krishna is in the coffee shop at time K (his first visit), then he's not there at time K+1 (when K≠1). This is also true for each of the N girls. Also, everyone starts at the same time, assume it to be 0.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output:
For each test case print a single line containing an integer denoting the minimum amount of time Krishna has to wait.
If this value exceeds 1018, print −1 instead, because that's the expected value of one's lifetime, and he can't wait for his whole life.
Constraints:

1≤T≤105
1≤N≤105
1≤K≤1018
1≤Ai≤1018, for each valid i
Sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 106

Subtasks:

10 points:
1≤N≤10
1≤K≤100
1≤Ai≤100, for each valid i
Sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 100
30 points:
1≤N≤103
1≤K≤109
1≤Ai≤109, for each valid i
Sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 104
60 points: original constraints

Sample Input:
2
3 3
1 2 4
5 4
17 12 46 8 31

Sample Output:
3
8

Explanation:

Example Case 1: He can meet the first girl at his first visit (it would be the girl's 3rd visit). So, 3 is the minimum wait time.
Example Case 2: He can meet the fourth girl at his second visit (it would be the girl's 1st visit). So, 8 is the minimum wait time.
