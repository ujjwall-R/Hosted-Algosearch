Chefland consists of n cities numbered 1, 2, …n. The cities numbered 1, 2, …k are special cities. For each unordered pair i,j, there exists a bidirectional road, destroying which has a cost of wi,j. Find the minimum cost of destroying some subset of roads so that no two special cities have a path between them after the removal of these roads.
Input
There are multiple independent testcases.

First line will contain T, number of testcases.
The first line of each testcase contains n and k, the number of cities and the number of special cities respectively.
The jth integer in ith of the next n lines is wij.

Output
For each testcase, output the minimum cost of destroying some subset of roads so that no two special cities have a path between them after the removal of these roads.
Constraints

1≤T≤5
3≤n≤20
3≤k≤n
The sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 20.
For all i, wii=0
For all i≠j, wij=wji, 1≤wij≤106

Example Input
1
4 3
0 1 4 2
1 0 2 2
4 2 0 3
2 2 3 0

Example Output
11

Explanation
Remove the roads (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4) to get a cost of 1+4+2+2+2=11.
