Chef has found an integer array A of length N. He defines the beauty of an array as the maximal value of gcd(Al,Al+1,…,Ar)⋅(r−l+1) over all the subsegments [l,r] of the array A.
Chef loves to explore, so aside from the beauty of the initial array, he wants to know the beauty of the array after performing each of Q updates. Each update replaces a subsegment of the array with an arithmetic progression. Updates are cumulative.
Formally, in each update you are given four integers l, r, x, and y. Then for each i∈[l,r], you must replace Ai with x+y(i−l).
Input Format

The first line contains an integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
The first line of each test case contains two integers N and Q - the length of the array and the number of updates.
The second line contains N integers - the array A.
The next Q lines each contains four integers l, r, x, y - the description of an update: an arithmetic progression with the initial term x and the common difference y on the subsegment [l,r].

Output Format
For each test case, output Q+1 lines. In the first line for each test case output the beauty of the initial array, in the i-th (2≤i≤Q+1) line for each test case output the beauty of the array after performing i−1 changes.
Constraints

1≤N,Q≤105
1≤Ai,x≤109
0≤y≤109
1≤l≤r≤N
It is guaranteed that after each update, no element of A is greater than 109.
The sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105.
The sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 105.

Explanation
After the first operation A=[2,6,4,12,18,12]. The maximum value is reached on the segment [4,6].
After the second operation A=[2,2,6,10,14,12]. The maximum value is reached on the segment [5,5].
