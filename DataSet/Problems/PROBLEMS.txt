Chef is organising a contest with P problems (numbered 1 through P). Each problem has S subtasks (numbered 1 through S).
The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:

Let's denote the score of the k-th subtask of this problem by SCk and the number of contestants who solved it by NSk.
Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
Calculate the number n of valid indices k such that NSk>NSk+1.
For problem i, the difficulty is a pair of integers (n,i).

You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem a is more difficult than problem b if the number n is greater for problem a than for problem b, or if a>b and n is the same for problems a and b.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers P and S denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
2P lines follow. For each valid i, the 2i−1-th of these lines contains S space-separated integers SC1,SC2,…,SCS denoting the scores of the i-th problem's subtasks, and the 2i-th of these lines contains S space-separated integers NS1,NS2,…,NSS denoting the number of contestants who solved the i-th problem's subtasks.

Output
Print P lines containing one integer each — the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.
Constraints

1≤P≤100,000
2≤S≤30
1≤SCi≤100 for each valid i
1≤NSi≤1,000 for each valid i
in each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (25 points): S=2
Subtask #2 (75 points): original constraints
