Chef is going to start playing Fantasy Football League (FFL) this season. In FFL, each team consists of exactly 1515 players: 22 goalkeepers, 5 defenders, 5 midfielders and 3 forwards. Chef has already bought 13 players; he is only missing one defender and one forward.
There are N available players (numbered 1 through N). For each valid i, the i-th player is either a defender or a forward and has a price Pi. The sum of prices of all players in a team must not exceed 100 dollars and the players Chef bought already cost him S dollars.
Can you help Chef determine if he can complete the team by buying one defender and one forward in such a way that he does not exceed the total price limit?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and S.
The second line contains N space-separated integers P1,P2,…,PN.
The last line contains N space-separated integers. For each valid i, the i-th of these integers is 0 if the i-th player is a defender or 1 if the i-th player is a forward.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "yes" if it is possible to build a complete team or "no" otherwise (without quotes).

                        Sample Output 1
                        





yes
no


Explanation
Example case 1: If Chef buys the 1-st and 3-rd player, the total price of his team is 90+9=99, which is perfectly fine. There is no other valid way to pick two players.
Example case 2: Chef cannot buy two players in such a way that all conditions are satisfied.
