In a cricket game, an over is a set of six valid deliveries of balls performed by one player ― the bowler for this over.
Consider a cricket game with a series of NN overs (numbered 11 through NN) played by K players (numbered 1 through K). Each player may be the bowler for at most L overs in total, but the same player may not be the bowler for any two consecutive overs. Assign exactly one bowler to each over in such a way that these rules are satisfied or determine that no such assignment exists.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, K and L. 

Output
For each test case:

If there is no valid assignment of bowlers to overs, print a single line containing the integer −1.
Otherwise, print a single line containing N space-separated integers. For each valid i, the i-th of these integers should be the number of the player assigned as the bowler for the i-th over.

Constraints

1≤T≤30
1≤N,K,L≤10,000


                        Sample Input 1
                        





2
4 3 2
5 4 1



                        Sample Output 1
                        





1 2 3 2
-1


Explanation
Example case 1: The following is a valid assignment:

Bowler 1 bowls the 1-st over.
Bowler 2 bowls the 2-nd and 4-th overs.
Bowler 3 bowls the 3-rd over.

It is valid since no bowler bowls more than 2 overs and each two consecutive overs have different bowlers.
Example case 2: There is no valid assignment in which each of 4 players bowls at most 1 over out of 5.
