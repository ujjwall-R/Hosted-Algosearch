When the final results for the employement competition were announced, Nour Eddin Ramadan was thrilled to find his name among the accepted co-Chefs.
However, after a while Nour started wasting time at the kitchen. He would usually spend hours talking to girls, and he even invited a girl to the kitchen pretending that he is the most valuable employer at Chef's restaurant.
When Chef found out about it, he decided that it was time to teach Nour a lesson. Before going home that night, Chef called Nour to his office and asked him to solve the following problem, saying that he better come to work tomorrow with a solution for it, or otherwise, it would be better if he doesn't come at all:
Given T queries, where each query contains a single number Y, Nour has to find the number of pairs A and B, such that the following equation holds true:
A2 + B ≤ Y
Where A is any positive integer, and B holds (1 ≤ B ≤ 700).
Nour was really busy that night (Yeah he got that girl to go out with him after all!), and he asked for your help.
 
Input
The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases.
T lines follows, Each line contains a single integer Y denoting the right side of the formula.
Output
For each test print a single line, containing a single number, indicating the answer for the test.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 105
1 ≤ Y ≤ 1010
Note that A must be any positive integer, and B must hold 1 ≤ B ≤ 700.
