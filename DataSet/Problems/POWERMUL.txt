You are given a function f which is defined as :


Your task is to find the value of  f(N) / ( f(r)*f(N-r) ) . As it will be a large number output it modulo M. 
 Input 
 
First line contains T , number of test cases to follow.

Next follows T test case.

First line of ever test case contain 3 space separated integers N , M and Q.

Next Q line follows , each line contain r.
Output
 
For every test case , output Q lines , each line containing the answer.
Constraints

2 ≤  N  ≤ 105
1 ≤ M ≤ 109
2 ≤ Sum of N over all test cases ≤ 5*105
2 ≤ Sum of Q over all test cases ≤ 105
1 < r < N

Subtasks

 Subtask 1:  N ≤ 5 , rest of the constraints are same. Points - 9 
 Subtask 2:  N ≤ 500 , M is a prime number , rest of the constraints are same. Points - 31 
 Subtask 3: Refer to constraints above : Points-60

Explanation
f[1] = 1
f[2] = 4
f[3] = 1*22*33 = 108
f[4] =1*22*33*44 = 27648
f[5] = 1*22*33*44*55 =86400000
value of f[5] / (f[2]*f[3]) = 200000 and 200000%24 is 8
