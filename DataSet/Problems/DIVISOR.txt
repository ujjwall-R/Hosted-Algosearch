Given an integer N, you can apply a operation on NN multiple times(possibly 0).        
Operation is defined as follows:    

Choose a positive integer KK such that KK has exactly 4 divisors and K is a divisor of N.    
Change N to N/K.         

Find the minimum number of divisors possible of the resulting number N. 
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integers N.

Output:
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of divisors possible of the resulting number.

Explanation
Example case 1: We cannot divide N=3 by any valid K and hence output is 2 as N=3 has exactly two divisors 1 and 3.  
Example case 2: N=64 can be divided by 8 twice as 8 has exactly 4 divisors ( 1, 2, 4, 8 )  and hence the resultant value of N will be 1 and 1 has only 1 divisor hence answer is 1.   
Example case 3: We can divide N=30 by 6, 10 or 15 as all three of them have exactly 4 divisors. In each case resultant value of N will be either 5, 3 or 2. And all three of them has exactly 2 divisors and they cannot be divided further. Hence the output is 2.     
Example case 4: One of the optimal ways to divide N=120 is divide 120 by 8 followed by dividing  by 15. The resultant value will be 120/8=15 and 15/15=1. The number 1 has exactly one divisor and hence output is 1.
Note that, If we divided N=120 by 6 then we won't get the optimal answer.       
Example case 5: We can divide N=45 by 15 and resultant value of N will be 3. The number 3 has exactly 2 divisors and hence output is 2
