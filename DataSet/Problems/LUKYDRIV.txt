            "Nine is considered a good number in Chinese culture because it sounds the same as the word "long-lasting". Hence many
            people want their car registration numbers to sum up to 9 on adding the digits recursively.
        



A car registration number can consist of 1,2,3 or 4 digits. Examples of some good car numbers are 63, 018, 9099, etc. whereas 12,129 are not            good.
        


Why is 9099 good?


9+0+9+9 = 27


2+7 = 9 


Similarly it is not difficult to see why 63, 018, 6669, 9999… are good."


        Given a string of digits, print how many subsequences of the string result in good car registration numbers.
    

Note:


        The zeros at the starting of the number are to be accounted for, i.e. 018 and 18 are different numbers.
    

Input


        First line of the input contains T (T <= 200) denoting the number of test cases. T lines follow each containing a non-empty single
        string S. S contains only digits i.e. from [0-9]. Length of S <= 10000.
    

Output


        For each case print how many subsequences of the string result in good car registration numbers. As the answer can be quite large print it modulo 1000000007.
