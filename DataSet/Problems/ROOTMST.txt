You are given a weighted simple undirected graph with NN vertices, which are numbered from 11 to N. You are guaranteed that vertex 1 is not an articulation point (which means that even after removing the vertex 1, the remaining graph is connected) and has an edge connecting it to each of the other N−1 vertices.
For each K∈{1,2,…,N−1} you need to find the minimum weight of a spanning tree where the degree of vertex 1 is equal to K.
Input:

The first line of input contains two integers N,M: the number of vertices and edges in the graph.
Each of the next M lines contains three integers Ui,Vi,Wi, denoting an edge between vertices Ui and Vi with weight Wi.

Output:
Print N−1 integers in a single line -  the minimum weight of a spanning tree where the degree of vertex 1 is equal to 1,2,…,N−1.
Constraints

2≤N≤100000
2N−3≤M≤200000
1≤Wi≤200000
1≤Ui<Vi≤N
It is guaranteed that the graph contains no multiple edges and vertex 1 is not an articulation point and its degree is equal to N−1.
