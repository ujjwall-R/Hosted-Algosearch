You are given a sequence of integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and an integer KK. Find the number of contiguous subsequences AL,AL+1,…,ARAL,AL+1,…,AR such that R−L+1≥K and the K-th element of the subsequence (AL+K−1) is equal to the maximum of all elements of the entire sequence.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer --- the number of contiguous subsequences satisfying the given conditions.
Constraints

1≤T≤200
1≤K≤N≤2⋅105
