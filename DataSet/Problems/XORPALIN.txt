In this problem, we are working with binary strings with length KK. A binary string contains only characters '0' and '1'. The bitwise XOR of two such strings XX and Y (denoted by X⊕Y) is also a binary string with length K.
You have a sequence A of binary strings, indexed from 1. Initially, it is empty.
You should process Q queries. In each query:

You are given two integers L and R (0≤L≤R<2K). For each i (L≤i≤R), consider the string which is the binary representation of i, possibly padded with leading zeros so its length is exactly K; append this string to A. In total, you should append (R−L+1) strings to A in this query.
Then, compute the number of pairs (i,j) (1≤i<j≤|A|) such that (Ai⊕Aj) is a palindrome. Since this number can be very large, compute it modulo 998,244,353.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers Q and K.
Each of the next Q lines contains two space-separated integers L and R describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer — the number of pairs of strings in A such that their XOR is a palindrome, modulo 998,244,353.

Explanation
Example case 1: The sequence A after the first query is ["011", "100", "101", "110"]. The valid pairs of indices are (1,2), (2,4) and (1,4).
After the second query, the sequence A is ["011", "100", "101", "110", "010", "011"]. The valid pairs of indices are (1,2), (2,4), (1,4), (3,5), (1,6), (2,6) and (4,6).
