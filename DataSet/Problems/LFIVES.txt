You are given a sequence a1,a2,…,aNa1,a2,…,aN of non-negative integers. Your task is to process QQ queries of the following format: each query is described by two integers L≤RL≤R and asks to calculate the number of triples (i,j,k), such that L<i<j<k<R and aL>ai<aj>ak<aR.
Input

The first line of the input contains two integers N and Q denoting the size of the sequence and the number of the queries to process.
The second line contains N non-negative integers a1,a2,…,aN.
Each of the next Q lines contains two integers L and R describing the corresponding query.

Output
For each query, output a single line containing one integers: the number of triples as described above.
Constraints

1≤N≤2000
1≤Q≤100000
0≤ai≤109
1≤L≤R≤N for each query in the input

Example Input
10 3
5 5 1 1 5 5 1 1 5 5
1 10
2 9
1 1

Example Output
8
8
0

Explanation
The following triples (i,j,k) are valid for the first and the second queries: 

(3,5,7)
(3,5,8)
(3,6,7)
(3,6,8)
(4,5,7)
(4,5,8)
(4,6,7)
