There are N shops in a city, each producing a particular number of Vada Pavs. You are also given an integer K. Find the difference between the sum of the Vada Pavs produced in the K largest Vada Pavs producing shops and that of the K least Vada Pavs producing shops.
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
First line of each testcase contains two integers N,K.
Second line of each testcase contains N spaced integers.

Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line the required answer.
Constraints

Explanation
Case 1: 
Since K=2, 2 Largest Vada Pavs selling shops produces 3 and 2 Vada Pavs respectively, similarly 2 Smallest Vada Pavs selling shops produces 2 and 1 Vada Pavs respectively. Hence the required answer will be (3+2)-(2+1)=2.                                                                         
Case 2: 
Since K=1, The Largest Vada Pav shop sells 5 Vada Pavs whereas the Smallest Vada Pav shop sells 1 Vada Pav, therefore the required answer is 5-1=4.
