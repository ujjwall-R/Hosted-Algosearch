Shivigawdz judges the "efficiency" of his Death Note as the average number of people he can kill per page. His shinigami, Siddhant, had already written a number of names. However, Siddhant was every uneven in how he used the Death Note.
Shivigawdz wants to use some of the N pages of the death note on the first day such that he has maximum efficiency.
Given the number of people he can kill using each page, help him select a continuous set of atleast AA and atmost BB pages which help him get the maximum efficiency.
In formal language, given an array of length NN, find the maximum average of the numbers of any contiguous subarray of length between A and B, inclusive.
Input:
The first line of the input contains T, the number of testcases.
The first line of the each test case contains 3 integers, N, B and A (A≤B).
The next line contains N numbers, the number of names that can be written in the i-th page of the Death Note, for all 1≤i≤N.
Output:
Output 1 number, the maximum efficiency Shivigawdz can attain.
NOTE: You must output the answer correct upto atleast 6 decimal places
Constraints

1≤N≤1000
1≤T≤5
All numbers in the array are between 0 and 1010 (inclusive)

Subtasks

100 points : 1≤N≤1000

Sample Input:
    1
5 3 2
1 2 3 4 5

Sample Output:
4.5000000

EXPLANATION:
He can use pages 4 and 5 for an average of (4+5)/2=4.5
