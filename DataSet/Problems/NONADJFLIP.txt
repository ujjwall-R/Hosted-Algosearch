You are given a binary string SS of length NN. You can perform the following operation on SS:

Pick any set of indices such that no two picked indices are adjacent.
Flip the values at the picked indices (i.e. change 00 to 1 and 1 to 0).

For example, consider the string S=1101101.
If we pick the indices {1,3,6}, then after flipping the values at picked indices, we will get 1_10_110_1→0111111.
Note that we cannot pick the set {2,3,5} since 2 and 3 are adjacent indices.
Find the minimum number of operations required to convert all the characters of S to 0.
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the length of the binary string S.
The second line of each test case contains a binary string S of length N.

Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of operations required to convert all the characters of S to 0.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤N≤100

Explanation
Test Case 1: Pick the set of indices {1,3,6}. On flipping the values at these indices, the string becomes 000000.
Test Case 2: The string already has all characters equal to 0.
