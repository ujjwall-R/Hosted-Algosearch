You are given an undirected graph, you need to find the shortest walk in the graph from source to sink which satisfies the following property:  
Let the shortest walk from source to sink be through edges E1 -> E2 -> ... -> Ek, then Weight(E1) > Weight(E2) < Weight(E3)  > Weight(E4) .....and so on.  
Formally, the difference between adjacent edge weights in shortest walk should keep on switching from positive to negative and from negative to positive. And the first difference should be positive.
Input Format
First Line contains T, the number of Test cases.
First line of each test case contains N the number of nodes and M the number of edges.  
Next M lines follows, each line contains 3 integers X, Y and Z, which denotes that there is an edge from X to Y with weight Z.  
Next line contains 2 integer source and sink.  
Output Format

For each test case, print the shortest walk satisfying the property. If no such walk exists then print "No Solution".  
Constraints
1 ≤ Sum of N over all test cases ≤ 100000 
1 ≤ Sum of M over all test cases ≤ 500000 
3 ≤ N ≤ 100000   
2 ≤ M ≤ 500000   
1 ≤ T ≤ 2000 
1 ≤ Z ≤ 100000000  
1 ≤ X,Y ≤ N  
 X != Y 
source !=  sink and there are no multi edges.
source and sink will not be connected by a direct edge

Explanation
For First Test Case: Shortest Valid Walk: 4->1->2->3  
For Second Test Case: There is no valid Walk satisfying the constraints.
