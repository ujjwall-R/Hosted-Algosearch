The kingdom of Treeland consists of N cities (numbered 1 through N) connected by N−1 bidirectional roads in such a way that there is a path between each pair of cities.
In order to increase security in Treeland, the government decided to set up police offices in K of its cities. For each valid i, the i-th office is in city Vi and it has a radius of efficiency Ri.
Let's define the security level Si of each city i as follows:

Initially, the security level of each city is equal to zero.
Then, for each police office j that was built (1≤j≤K), the security levels change in the following manner:
The security level of the city Vj increases by Rj.
The security levels of all cities at the distance 1 from Vj increase by Rj−1.
…
The security levels of all cities at the distance Rj−1 from Vj increase by 1.
Formally, for each city i, the j-th office increases the security level of this city by max(0,Rj−distance(i,Vj)).

Alice was in charge of calculating the new security levels of all cities after the offices were built. She already finished her job and noticed an interesting coincidence: for each valid i, SVi=Ri holds. Now she has challenged you to find the security levels of all cities.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
Then, N−1 lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting that cities u and v are connected by a road.
K more lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Vi and Ri.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers S1,S2,…,SN.
Constraints

1≤T≤2,000
2≤N,K≤8⋅105
1≤u,v≤N
1≤Vi≤N for each valid i
V1,V2,…,VK are pairwise distinct
1≤Ri for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 8⋅105
