Chef is an algorithmist so his friend has given him a problem.
 Problem is that you have been given an array A(indexed 1 through N). There is a thresold value ThTh. You need to find a maximum integer value M so that SS is greater or equal to ThTh.  
 Where,     S = ∑Ni=1max(Ai−M,0)     
 For example -  If A is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and Th=9, then M will be 3 and 
 S=max(1−3,0)+max(2−3,0)+max(3−3,0)+max(4−3,0)+max(5−3,0)+max(6−3,0)+max(7−3,0)     i.e, S=10 which greater than Th. Chef is very busy with his internship so he ask you to do this for him. You need to print maximum value M as well as S. 

Input : 

 First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
 Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers N,Th. 
Third line will contains A1,A2,A3,..........AN .


 Output: 
For each testcase, output two space separated integers M and S.

 Constraints 

 1≤T≤100 
2≤N≤100000 
1≤Th≤109 
 1≤Ai≤109
