You are given a function f which is defined as :
 
Your task is to find the value of 
 
where M is given in input.
Input Format
First line contains T, the number of test cases.
First line of each test case contain 3 space separated integers N, M and Q.
Next Q line follows, each line contain r.
Output Format
For each test case, output Q lines, each line containing the required answer.
Constraints
2 ≤ N ≤ 106
1 ≤ M ≤ 109
2 ≤ Sum of N over all test cases ≤ 106
1 ≤ Sum of Q over all test cases ≤ 2*105
1 ≤ T ≤ 105
1 < r < N

Explanation for first test case
f[1] = 1
f[2] = 2
f[3] = 1*22 * 3 = 12
f[4] =1*23*32*4 = 8*9*4 = 288
f[5] = 1*24*33*42*5 =34560
value of f[5] / (f[2]*f[3]) = 1440 and 1440 %114 is 72
