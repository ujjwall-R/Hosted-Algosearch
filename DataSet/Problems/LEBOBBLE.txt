Little Elephant loves bubble sorting.
Bubble sorting for any array A of n integers works in the   following way:   
 var int i, j;  for i from n downto 1  {  for j from 1 to i-1   {   if (A[j] > A[j+1])  swap(A[j], A[j+1])  } } 
You are given an array B of n integers. Then the array A is created using array B as following : for each i (1 <= i <= n), we set Ai = Bi + d with the   probability Pi, otherwise Ai =   Bi.
Help Little Elephant to find the expect number of swaps that bubble sorting   will make when the array A is sorted with the above bubble sorting   algorithm.
Input
First line of the input contains single integer T - the number of test   cases. T test cases follows. First line of each test case contains pair of   integers n and d. Next line of each test case contains   n integers - array B. Next line contains n integers -   array P.
Output
In T lines print T real numbers - the answers for the   corresponding test case. Please round all numbers to exactly 4 digits after   decimal point.
Constraint
1 <= T <= 5
1 <= n <= 50000
1 <= Bi, d <= 10^9
0 <= Pi, <= 100
