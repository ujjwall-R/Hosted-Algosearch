Hey Welcome to competitive coding event of Code_Blasters !
So let's start with a warm up exercise first.
chef is a master of two number game ,and chef wants you to play this game with you as he has nothing to do due to COVID-19 lockdown.
The game is simple chef will give you two numbers (let's say aa and bb  ) and you need to tell whether the given two numbers can become equal after performing given operations.

Incrementing aa by 1 OR
decrementing b by 1

NOTE: you can perform the given two operations any number of times.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T .T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T   test   cases follows.
Each test case contains two space seperated integer a and b denoting the two number given by chef.

Output:

For each test case, print "YES"(without quotes) if it is possible to make a and b equal, else print "NO"(without quotes).

Constraints:

1≤T≤1000
1≤a≤106
1≤b≤106

Sample Input:
2
5 7
10000 5000

Sample Output:
YES
NO
