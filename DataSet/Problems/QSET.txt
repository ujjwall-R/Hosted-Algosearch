 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
You have a string of N decimal digits, denoted by numbers A1,A2, ..., AN.

Now you are given M queries, each of whom is of following two types.Type 1: 1 X Y: Replace AX by Y.
Type 2: 2 C D: Print the number of sub-strings divisible by 3 of the string denoted by AC,AC+1 ... 
AD.

Formally, you have to print the number of pairs (i,j) such that the string Ai,Ai+1...Aj, 
(C ≤ i ≤ j ≤ D), when considered as a decimal number, is divisible by 3.

Input
There is only one test case.
First line of input contains two space separated integers N, M.
Next line contains a string of N digits, denoting string A.
For next M lines, each line contains a query.
Each query is given by three space separated integers.
The first integer denotes type of the query. For each query of type 1, next two integers denote Xi, Yi. 
For each query of type 2, next two integers denote Ci, Di.
Output
For each query of type 2, print the required answer in a single line.
Constraints
0 ≤ Ai ≤ 9
1 ≤ Xi ≤ N
0 ≤ Yi ≤ 9
1 ≤ Ci ≤ Di ≤ N
Subtasks
Subtask #1 (10 points): 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 103 and only type 2 queries.
Subtask #2 (15 points): 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 103
Subtask #3 (20 points): 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 105 and only type 2 queries
Subtask #4 (55 points): 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 105

Explanation

For first query, the sub-strings S[1,1]="0", S[1,3]="012" and S[2,3]="12" are divisible by 3.
After second query, the string A becomes "01255".
For third query, only sub-string S[3,5]="255" is divisible by 3.
