You are given N sequences P1,P2,…,PN. Each of them is a permutation of numbers 1 through M.
Let's define a product of two permutations X and Y of numbers 1 through M as a permutation Z=X⋅Y such that Zi=YXi for each valid i.
You should answer Q queries. Each query is described by two numbers L and R. Let's define a permutation B=PL⋅PL+1⋅…⋅PR; the multiplication of permutations is evaluated left to right, i.e. as ((PL⋅PL+1)⋅…)⋅PR. The answer to a query is ∑Mi=1i⋅Bi.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.
N lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains M space-separated integers Pi,1,Pi,2,…,Pi,M denoting the permutation Pi.
The next line contains a single integer Q.
Each of the following Q lines contains two space-separated integers L and R describing one query.

Output
For each test case, print Q lines. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines should contain a single integer — the answer to the i-th query.

Explanation
Example case 1: 

query 1: B=[3,2,1], so the answer is 1⋅3+2⋅2+3⋅1=10
query 2: B=[3,1,2], the answer is 11
query 3: B=[2,3,1], the answer is 11
query 4: B=[1,2,3], the answer is 14
query 5: B=[2,3,1], the answer is 11
