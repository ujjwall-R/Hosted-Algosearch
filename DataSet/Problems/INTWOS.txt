After a lot of effort, Mausil Hash of SDC has been able to convince Sarma Templeton Investments to take placements interview. While you were browsing through the previous year's questions you came across the following question. The problem statement is as follows:
There are NN piles of chocolates where each pile has CiCi number of chocolates. At each turn you will select a pile and eat KK chocolates from it. You have to eat all the chocolates from all the piles in at most D turns. Find the smallest K such that you can eat all the chocolates in at most D turns. 
The director of the company Mr. Sarma likes people who write small codes. Try to impress him by writing your code as small as possible.
[Note: If at a moment no. of chocolates in a pile is less than K, then you will eat all of those chocolates and it is still counted as a normal turn.]
Input:

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers denoting N and D respectively.
The second line contains N space separated integers denoting C1,C2,….CN.

Output:

Print only one line containing a single integer denoting the smallest K as explained in the problem statement.
If it is not possible to find such K, then print −1.

Constraints

1≤N≤105
1≤Ci≤104
1≤D≤109

Sample Input:
5 7
1 2 4 2 4

Sample Output:
2
