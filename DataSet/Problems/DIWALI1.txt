Explanation
Test case 1:

Chef will buy 16 Fuljhari's and 4 Anar's which in total costs him 16⋅5+4⋅5=100 rupees. 
Next, he uses 16 Fuljhari's to light 164=4 Anar's. 
Since all the Fuljhari's are over, he can't light up any Chakri's.
So in total, he is able to light up 4+0=4 Anar's and Chakri's.
There is no other allocation giving a better answer than this.

Test case 2:

Chef will buy 4 Fuljhari's, 2 Anar's and 2 Chakri's which in total costs him 4⋅2+2⋅2+2⋅2=16 rupees. 
Next, he uses 2 Fuljhari's to light 21=2 Anar's. 
Next, he uses 2 Fuljhari's to light 21=2 Chakri's. 
So in total, he is able to light up 2+2=4 Anar's and Chakri's.
The other possible allocation could be buying 4 Fuljhari's, 3 Anar's, and 1 Chakri.
