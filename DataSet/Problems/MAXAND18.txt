Chef's good friend Shubham has an assignment to complete, but he is too lazy to do it, so he asked Chef to help him. On the other hand, Chef was busy in the kitchen, so he in turn asked you to help Shubham.
You are given a sequence of positive integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN and an integer KK. For any positive integer XX such that exactly K bits in the binary representation of X are equal to 1, consider the sum S=∑Ni=1(X∧Ai); here, ∧ denotes bitwise AND. You should choose X in such a way that S is maximum possible. If there is more than one such value of X, you should find the smallest one.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest possible value of X.
Constraints

1≤T≤1,000
1≤N≤105
1≤K≤30
1≤Ai≤109 for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (50 points): K≤2
Subtask #2 (50 points): original constraints

4 1
3 4 5 1



                        Sample Output 1

Explanation
Example case 1: Exactly one bit in X should be 1. Our options are:

If X=1, S=1+0+1+1=3.
If X=2, S=2+0+0+0=2.
If X=4, S=0+4+4+0=8.
For any greater valid X, S=0.

The maximum value of S is 8, so the answer is the only value of X where we get S=8.
