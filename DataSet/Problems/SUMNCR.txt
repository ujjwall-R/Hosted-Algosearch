"I'm a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact." - Sheldon.
After years of hard work, Sheldon was finally able to develop a formula which would diminish the real human contact.  
He found kk integers n1,n2...nkn1,n2...nk . Also he found that if he could minimize the value of m such that  ∑ki=1niCmi is even, where m = ∑ki=1mi, he would finish the real human contact.  
Since Sheldon is busy choosing between PS-4 and XBOX-ONE, he want you to help him to calculate the minimum value of m. 
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The 
description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer k.
Next line contains k space separated integers n1,n2...nk .

Output:
For each test case output the minimum value of m for which ∑ki=1niCmi is even, where  m=m1+m2+. . . mk   and  0 <= mi<= ni .  If no such answer exists print -1.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
1≤k≤1000
1≤ni≤1018
