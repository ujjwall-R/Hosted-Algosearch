Chef has a string AA with length NN. It contains only characters '(', ')' and '*'. Chef wants to perform the following process:

Uniformly randomly choose a pair of integers (l,r)(l,r) such that 1≤l≤r≤N.
Consider the substring S=[Al,Al+1,…,Ar]. Process the characters of this string from left to right.
Let's denote the current number of closing brackets in S up to the currently processed character (inclusive) by nc. Similarly, let's denote the number of opening brackets by no. Note that the string S may change; nc and no correspond to the current state of S, not its initial state.
Whenever nc becomes greater than no, the currently processed character must be ')'. Then, change it from ')' to '(' and continue processing the remaining characters of S.

Chef would like to know the expected number of characters that he would change in this process. Can you help him?
It can be proved that this expected value can be expressed as a fraction P/Q, where P and Q are non-negative integers and Q is coprime to 109+7. You should find P⋅Q−1 modulo 109+7, where Q−1 denotes the multiplicative inverse of Q modulo 109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains a single string A with length N.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer P⋅Q−1 modulo 109+7.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤N≤107
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 107
