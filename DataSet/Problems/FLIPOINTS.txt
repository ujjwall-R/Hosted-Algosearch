You are given a set SS of NN distinct integer points in the 2D2D plane. Initially, each point has a color, either red or green. 
You have to perform some number of operations (possibly 00) on this set of points such that all points are green after all operations.
An operation is:

Choose some line that does not pass through any of the points in SS. This line should also not pass through the origin.
The line divides the space into two half-planes. Let QQ be the set of all points in SS that are also in the same half-plane as the origin.
Flip the colors of all the points in QQ. That is, if a point in QQ had the color red then it becomes green and vice versa.

What is the minimum number of operations that need to be done to convert all the points to green color?
It can be proven that it's always possible to convert any set of colored points to the green color in a finite number of operations.
Input Format

The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN - the size of SS.
The next line contains a string of length NN where the ii-th character of the string is RR if the i-th point is red and G if it's green.
The i-th line of next N lines contains two integers xi,yi - the coordinates of the i-th point of set S.

Output Format

For every test case, you must print the minimum number of operations needed to convert all points to green color.

Constraints

1≤N≤17
−106≤xi,yi≤106
(xi,yi)≠(0,0) for all i
All points are pairwise distinct
