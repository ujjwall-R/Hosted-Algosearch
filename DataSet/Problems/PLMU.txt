Chef has a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. He needs to find the number of pairs (i,j)(i,j) (1≤i<j≤N1≤i<j≤N) such that Ai+Aj=Ai⋅Aj. However, he is busy, so he asks for your help.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the desired number of pairs.
Constraints

1≤T≤20
1≤N≤40,000
0≤Ai≤109 for each valid i

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (30 points): 1≤N≤500
Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints
