Please note that the two versions of this problem differ only by constraints. The problem statement is exactly the same in both.
You are given two strings A and B of lengths N and M respectively. Find the maximum length of a substring of A that is also present in B. Let this maximum length be K. Also, find all such substrings of length K that is present in both A and B and print the number of times each such substring occurs in B. 
Input:

First line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.
First line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, N and M.
Second line of each test case contains two space-separated strings, A and B.

Output:
For each test case, output in the first line K, the maximum length of a common substring. Then follows X lines of output, where X denotes the number of substrings in A of length K that is also present in B. In each such line, print the substring of length K present in both the strings and the number of times that substring occurs in B (separated by a single space). The substrings must follow a lexicographic order, i.e., you must first print the substring that will occur earlier in a dictionary than the others.
Constraints

1≤T≤500
1≤N,M≤5∗104
Sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 105
Sum of M over all test cases doesn't exceed 105
All strings consist of lowercase latin letters only
