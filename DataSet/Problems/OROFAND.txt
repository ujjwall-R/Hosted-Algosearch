You are given an array AA with NN integers. An array's score is defined as the bitwise AND of all its elements. You need to find the bitwise OR of the scores of all possible non-empty subarrays of AA.
Furthermore, there are Q queries. Each query consists of two integers X and V. You need to change the value of the element at index X to V. After each query, you again need to find the bitwise OR of the scores of all possible non-empty subarrays.
See the example for more clarification.
Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q - the size of the array and the number of queries, respectively.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,…,AN.
Each of the next Q lines contains two space-separated integers X and V - the position and the new value of the query, respectively.
Output:
For each test case print Q+1 lines. In the first line print the answer for the original array and in the next Q lines print the answer after every query.
Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤N,Q≤105
0≤Ai≤231−1
1≤X≤N
0≤V≤231−1
The sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105
The sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 105

Explanation
Example case 1: For the original array, all possible subarrays and their scores are as follows.
AND(1)=1, AND(2)=2, AND(3)=3, AND(1,2)=0, AND(2,3)=2, AND(1,2,3)=0.
The bitwise OR of all possible subarray's score is OR(1,2,3,0,2,0)=3.
After the first query new array will be [4,2,3] and the answer will be 7.
After the second query new array will be [4,2,0] and the answer will be 6.
