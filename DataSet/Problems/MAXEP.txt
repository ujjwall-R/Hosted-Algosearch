This is an interactive problem.
Max has an electrical panel. He knows that there is an integer xx (1≤x≤N1≤x≤N) such that if the panel is connected to voltage greater or equal to xx, it will break. However, he does not know the exact value of x.
You must help Max determine x. You may perform operations of two types:

Connect the panel to voltage y, where y is an arbitrary integer between 1 and N inclusive. This operation costs 1 coin, and you may only perform it if the panel is not broken. After this operation, you find out whether the panel is broken.
Fix the broken panel. This operation costs c coins.

Each operation may be performed any number of times as long as you have enough coins. Initially, you have 1,000 coins.
Interaction

First, you should read a line containing two space-separated integers N and c.
To perform an operation of the first type, you should print a line containing two space-separated integers 1 and y. Then, you must read a line containing a single integer: 0 if the panel is not broken after this operation, 1 if it is broken or −1 if the operation was invalid (you could also get a direct WA if the operation is invalid).
To perform an operation of the second type, you should print a line containing a single integer 2.
Finally, you should print a line containing two space-separated integers 3 and x.

Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!
