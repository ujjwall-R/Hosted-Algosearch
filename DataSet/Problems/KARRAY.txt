Consider NN families (numbered 00 through N−1N−1). Each year, each family gives gifts to all other families based on the gifts they received in the previous year. Let's say that in some year, family i received gifts with value ai (from all families in total). Then, for each valid j, the value of the gifts given by family i to family j in the next year is G(i,j)⋅ai, where G(i,j)=2⋅(i∨j)−(i+j); note that ∨ denotes bitwise OR.
For each valid i, you are given the total value of gifts received by family i in the year 0. Find the total values of gifts received by each family in the year K. Since these values can be very large, compute them modulo 109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers a0,a1,…,aN−1. For each valid i, ai denotes the total value of gifts received by family i in the year 0.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing N integers. For each i (0≤i<N), the i+1-th of these integers should be the total value of gifts received by family i in the year K, modulo 109+7.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
