Let's call a directed graph egg-free if it is acyclic and for any three pairwise distinct vertices xx, yy and z, if the graph contains edges x→y and x→z, then it also contains an edge y→z and/or an edge z→y.
You are given an undirected graph with N vertices (numbered 1 through N) and M edges (numbered 1 through M). Find a way to assign a direction to each of its edges such that the resulting directed graph is egg-free, or determine that it is impossible. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.
M lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers ui and vi denoting an edge between vertices ui and vi.

Output
For each test case:

If it is impossible to assign a direction to each edge in such a way that the resulting graph is egg-free, print a single line containing the string "No solution" (without quotes).
Otherwise, print a single line containing a string with length M. For each valid i, the i-th character of this string should be '^' if you want to direct the i-th edge from ui to vi, or 'v' if you want to direct it from vi to ui.

Constraints

1≤T≤5
1≤N,M≤200,000
1≤ui,vi≤N for each valid i
ui≠vi for each valid i
each pair of vertices is connected by at most one edge
