An array is called lovely if the sum of product of each adjacent pair of elements is odd.
More formally, the array SS of size MM is lovely if the value ∑M−1i=1∑M−1i=1 (Si.Si+1)(Si.Si+1) is odd.
You are given an array A consisting of N positive integers. Find a permutation of array A which is lovely. 
If multiple such permutations are possible, output any. If there is no lovely permutation, output -1.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each test case, if a lovely permutation of A is possible, print a single line containing N integers denoting the elements of any lovely permutation of A. Otherwise, print -1.

Explanation
Test Case 1: The sum of products of adjacent pair of elements of the given array is 1⋅2+2⋅3+3⋅4+4⋅10=2+6+12+40=60. Since this value is even, this is not a lovely permutation of the array.
A lovely permutation of the given array is [3,1,10,2,4]. The sum of products for this array would be 3⋅1+1⋅10+10⋅2+2⋅4=41, which is odd.
Test Case 2: No permutation of the given array exists where the sum of products of adjacent pair of elements is odd. Thus, answer is −1.
