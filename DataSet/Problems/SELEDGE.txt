You are given an undirected graph GG with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN) and MM edges (numbered 11 through MM). GG does not contain any self-loops, but it may contain parallel edges. For each valid ii, the ii-th vertex has a non-negative integer weight AiAi. Also, for each valid ii, the ii-th edge has a non-negative integer weight BiBi.
Let E={1,2,…,M}E={1,2,…,M} denote the set of edges and for any subset S⊆ES⊆E, let V(S)V(S) denote the set of vertices which are endpoints of at least one edge from SS. You should find
maxS⊆E,|S|≤K(∑v∈V(S)Av−∑e∈SBe).
In other words, among all subsets of at most K (but possibly zero) edges, you should find the largest value of the expression "sum of weights of their endpoints, where each endpoint is counted only once, minus the sum of weights of these edges". Note that S may contain multiple parallel edges with the same weights ― they are still considered distinct.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
M lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers ui, vi and Bi, describing an edge between vertices ui and vi with weight Bi.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the largest value of the given expression.

Explanation
Example case 1:

The largest value is obtained when S contains only edges (2,5) and (3,4). In that case, V(S) contains the vertices 2,3,4,5.
