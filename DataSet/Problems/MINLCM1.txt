You are given two positive integers XX and KK.
You have to output the minimum and maximum value of LCM(i,j)LCM(i,j) where X≤i<j≤X⋅K. 
We define LCM(i,j) for two positive integers i and j as the minimum positive integer y such that both i and j divide y without remainder. 
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two space separated integers X and K.

Output Format
For each testcase, output two space separated integers - the minimum and maximum possible value respectively of LCM(i,j) where X≤i<j≤X⋅K. 
Constraints

1≤T≤105
1≤X≤108
2≤K≤108
It is guaranteed that, for each test case, X⋅K≤109

Explanation
Test Case 1: We want to find the minimum and maximum value of LCM(i,j) for 4≤i<j≤12.
It is easy to verify that the LCM(4,8)=8 is the minimum possible value whereas LCM(11,12)=132 is the maximum value. 
Test Case 2: We want to find the minimum and maximum value of LCM(i,j) for 2≤i<j≤6. The maximum value is obtained for the pair (5,6) whereas the minimum is obtained for the pair (2,4).
