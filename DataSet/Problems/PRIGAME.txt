Chef and Divyam are playing a game with the following rules:

First, an integer X! is written on a board.
Chef and Divyam alternate turns; Chef plays first.
In each move, the current player should choose a positive integer D which is divisible by up to Y distinct primes and does not exceed the integer currently written on the board. Note that 1 is not a prime.
D is then subtracted from the integer on the board, i.e. if the integer written on the board before this move was A, it is erased and replaced by A−D.
When one player writes 0 on the board, the game ends and this player wins.

Given X and Y, determine the winner of the game.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers X and Y.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Chef" if Chef wins the game or "Divyam" if Divyam wins (without quotes).
Constraints

Chef
Divyam 
Divyam


Explanation
Example case 1: Since D=1 is divisible by 0 primes, Chef will write 0 and win the game in the first move.
Example case 2: Chef must choose D between 1 and 5 inclusive, since D=6 is divisible by more than one prime. Then, Divyam can always choose 6−D, write 0 on the board and win the game.
