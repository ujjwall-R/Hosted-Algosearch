A permutation of length NN is an array of NN integers P=[P1,P2,…,PN]P=[P1,P2,…,PN] such that every integer from 1 to N (inclusive) appears in it exactly once. For example, [2,3,4,1] is a permutation of length 4.
A subsegment of an array A[L…R]=[AL,AL+1,…,AR] is called good if the subsegment is a permutation of length (R−L+1). For example, the array A=[2,3,1,4,2] contains 3 good subsegments: A[3…3]=[1], A[1…3] =[2,3,1], A[2…5]=[3,1,4,2].
You are given two integers N and K. Find a permutation of length N such that it contains exactly K good subsegments. Print -1 if no such permutation exists.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases then follow:
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N,K.

Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer:

If no permutation satisfies the given conditions, print −1.
Otherwise, print N space-separated integers P1,P2,…,PN, denoting the elements of the permutation. If there are multiple answers, you can output any of them.

Constraints

1≤T≤103
1≤N≤105
1≤K≤N
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅105.

Explanation
Test case 1: The only permutation of length 1 is [1], which contains one good subsegment A[1…1].
Test case 2: The permutation [1,3,2] contains 2 good subsegments: A[1…1], A[1…3].
Test case 3: There is no way to construct a permutation of length 4 which contains one good subsegment.
Test case 4: The permutation [5,3,1,4,2] contains 3 good subsegments: A[3…3],A[2…5],A[1…5]. There are other permutations of length 5 having 3 good subsegments.
