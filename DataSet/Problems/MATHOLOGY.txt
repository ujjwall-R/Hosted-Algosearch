After solving some Number Theory related problems KBG challenged VD to solve following problem.
You are given an array AA consisting of NN positive integers and QQ queries. Each query is of the form:

L R: Given two integers L and R (1≤L<R≤N), let B denote the subarray A[L,R]. Find the maximum possible GCD of any subsequence of B which has length greater than 1.

For each query, find the maximum possible GCD of any subsequence in the given range having length greater than 1.
Input Format

First line contains T, number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a two space-separated integer N and Q - length of the array and number of queries respectively.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,...,AN.
Next Q lines of each test case contains two space-separated integers L and R.

Output Format
For each test case, print Q lines. The ith line contains one integer - the answer for the ith query.
Constraints

1≤T≤105
2≤N≤105 
1≤Q≤105
1≤Ai≤105
1≤L<R≤N
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105.
Sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 105.

Subtasks

Subtask 1 (5 points): 2≤N≤10 , 1≤Q≤10 , 1≤T≤100
Subtask 2 (10 points): 2≤N≤103 , 1≤Q≤103. Sum of N and Q over all test cases does not exceed 103.
Subtask 3 (25 points): 2≤N≤103, 1≤Q≤105. Sum of N and Q over all test cases does not exceed 103 and 105 respectively. 
Subtask 4 (60 points): Original Constraints.

Explanation
Test Case 1: Given A=[5,4,15,6,10,8] and 2 queries.

In the first query, L=1 and R=5. Thus, the subarray B=[5,4,15,6,10]. One of the subsequences of B having maximum GCD and length greater than 1 is [5,15,10]. The GCD of this subsequence is GCD(5,15,10)=5. It can be proven that no other subsequence of B having length greater than 1 has a GCD greater than 5.
In the second query, L=4 and R=6. Thus, the subarray B=[6,10,8]. One of the subsequences of B having maximum GCD and length greater than 1 is [6,10,8]. The GCD of this subsequence is GCD(6,10,8)=2. It can be proven that no other subsequence of B having length greater than 1 has a GCD greater than 2.
