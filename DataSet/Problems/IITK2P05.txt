This problem is simple. You will be given an integer  N  and you need to factorize that number. To help you with factorization of  N , you will also be given  phi(N) . 

 phi(x)  is also known as Euler's Totient  function.
 phi(x)  is defined as number of positive integers less than or equal to x which are relatively prime to  x  (i.e, greatest common divisor is 1).

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two space separated integers representing N and  phi(N)  respectively. N  denotes the number to be factorized.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the prime factors of  N  in non decreasing order. See example for clarity.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 20
2 ≤ N ≤ 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1018)

Example
Input:
3
8 4
36 12
450 120

Output:
2 2 2
2 2 3 3
2 3 3 5 5
