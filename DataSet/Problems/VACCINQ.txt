There are NN people in the vaccination queue, Chef is standing on the PthPth position from the front of the queue. It takes X minutes to vaccinate a child and Y minutes to vaccinate an elderly person. Assume Chef is an elderly person.
You are given a binary array A1,A2,…,AN of length N, where Ai=1 denotes there is an elderly person standing on the ith position of the queue, Ai=0 denotes there is a child standing on the ith position of the queue. You are also given the three integers P,X,Y. Find the number of minutes after which Chef's vaccination will be completed.
Input Format

First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
The first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers N,P,X,Y.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integer A1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line the number of minutes after which Chef's vaccination will be completed.
Constraints

Explanation
Test case 1: The person standing at the front of the queue is a child and the next person is Chef. So it takes a total of 3+2=5 minutes to complete Chef's vaccination.
Test case 2: Chef is standing at the front of the queue. So his vaccination is completed after 3 minutes.
Test case 3: Chef is standing at the rear of the queue. So it takes a total of 2+2+2=6 minutes to complete Chef's vaccination.
