You have been recently hired as a developer in CodeChef. Your first mission is to implement a feature that will determine the number of submissions that were judged late in a contest.
There are N submissions, numbered 1 through N. For each valid i, the i-th submission was submitted at time Si and judged at time Ji (in minutes). Submitting and judging both take zero time. Please determine how many submissions received their verdicts after a delay of more than 5 minutes.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of the input contains a single integer N.
N lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Si and Ji.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of submissions for which the judging was delayed by more than 5 minutes.
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤N≤100
1≤Si≤Ji≤300 for each valid i

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints

Explanation
Example case 1: The delays of the respective submissions are 2 minutes, 0 minutes, 6 minutes, 10 minutes and 5 minutes. Only submissions 3 and 4 are delayed by more than 5 minutes, hence the answer is 2.
