Explanation

Test case 1: Chef has 5 friends. The cost of buying a burger for each of them will be 10×5=50 while Chef has 70 rupees. Therefore, he can buy a burger for all of them.
Test case 2: Chef has 5 friends. The cost of buying a burger for each of them will be 10×5=50 while Chef has 40 rupees. Therefore, he can not buy a burger for all of them.
Test case 3: Chef has 10 friends. The cost of buying a burger for each of them will be 40×10=400 and Chef has 400 rupees. Therefore, he can buy a burger for all of them.
Test case 4: Chef has 14 friends. The cost of buying a burger for each of them will be 14×14=196 while Chef has 150 rupees. Therefore, he can not buy a burger for all of them.
