You have two arrays A and B, each containing N integers.
Elements of array B cannot be modified.
You may perform an arbitrary number of operations (including zero number of operations). In one operation, you can choose one index i (1 ≤ i ≤ N) and increment Ai by 1. Each index can be chosen any number of times.

Find the minimum number of operations required to modify the array A such that for every pair i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ N), 
(Ai % Bi) equals (Aj % Bj). Here, % denotes the modulo operator (the remainder after dividing by Bi). Note that 0 ≤ (Ai % Bi) < Bi.

Input
First line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of testcases. The description of T testcases is as follows:
First line of each testcase contains a positive integer N, denoting the number of elements in arrays A and B.
Second line contains N space-separated whole numbers A1, A2, ..., AN.
Third line contains N space-separated natural numbers B1, B2, ..., BN.
Output
For each testcase, output a single line containing the minimum number of operations required to modify the array A in order to satisfy the required conditions. 
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ N ≤ 5 * 105
0 ≤ Ai ≤ 109
1 ≤ Bi ≤ 109
Sum of N across all testcases in a single file will be ≤ 5 * 105

Example
Input:
2
3
4 2 2
5 3 4
4
2 1 1 2
3 3 3 3

Output:
3
2

Explanation

Example case 1.
A1 can be increased from 4 to 7 in 3 operations so that:
	
A1 % B1 = 2
A2 % B2 = 2
A3 % B3 = 2



Example case 2.
A2, A3 can both be increased from 1 to 2 in 2 operations total so that:
	
A1 % B1 = 2
A2 % B2 = 2
A3 % B3 = 2
A4 % B4 = 2
