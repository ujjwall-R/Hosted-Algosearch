MoEngage has 3 decks. Each deck consists of N cards, numbered from 1 to N. He draws out 1 card from each deck randomly with each card having an equal probability of being drawn.
MoEngage drew cards numbered A and B from the decks 1 and 2 respectively. Now, he wonders what is the probability that he will end up with a funny hand after drawing the third card.
A funny hand is when 3 consecutive numbered cards are present in your hand.
Help MoEngage calculate the probability of ending up with a funny hand after drawing the third card.
If the final probability of ending up with a funny hand is P, you need to print the value P⋅N. It can be shown that this value is an integer.
Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of input consisting of three space-separated integers N,A, and B denoting the size of each deck, the card drawn from the first deck, and the card drawn from the second deck respectively.

Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer, denoting P⋅N on a separate line.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
3≤N≤1000
1≤A,B≤N

Explanation
Test case 1: Drawing the cards 1 or 4 will result in a funny hand. Hence, the probability will be P=12. The value P⋅N=12⋅4=2.
Test case 2: Drawing the card 3 will result in a funny hand. Hence, the probability will be P=16. The value P⋅N=16⋅6=1.
Test case 3: No matter what card MoEngage draws, he will never end up with a funny hand.
