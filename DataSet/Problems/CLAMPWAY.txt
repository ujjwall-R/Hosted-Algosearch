You are given a tree with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN).
A simple path between two different vertices a and b (a<b) is called a clamp path if it does not contain any vertices with numbers smaller then a or greater than b.
Calculate the number of clamp paths in the given tree.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers p1,p2,…,pN. For each valid i, if pi≠0, then there is an edge between vertices i and pi.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer - the number of clamp paths.
Constraints

2≤N≤220
0≤pi≤N for each valid i
there is exactly one vertex i with pi=0
the graph described on the input is a tree

Example Input
7
0 5 5 1 4 1 4

Example Output
10

Explanation
The clamp paths are 1 - 4, 1 - 5, 1 - 6, 1 - 7, 2 - 5, 2 - 7, 3 - 5, 3 - 7, 4 - 5 and 4 - 7.
