Explanation
Test Case 1: Days 6,13,20 and 27 are Saturdays, and days 7,14,21,28 are Sundays. The festivals fall on day 5 and day 7, but day 7 is already a Sunday. This gives us 9 holidays in total — days 5,6,7,13,14,20,21,27,28.
Test Case 2: Days 6,13,20 and 27 are Saturdays, and days 7,14,21,28 are Sundays. The festivals fall on day 1, day 6, and day 23. This gives us 10 holidays in total — days 1,6,7,13,14,20,21,23,27,28.
Test Case 3: Days 6,13,20 and 27 are Saturdays, and days 7,14,21,28 are Sundays. The only festival is on day 13, which is already a holiday. This gives us 8 holidays in total — days 6,7,13,14,20,21,27,28.
