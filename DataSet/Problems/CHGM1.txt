At the end of the game, a group of contiguous people will be awarded with prize money, if the sum of points of them is maximum. Chef want to know the maximum sum.
 Note : Group can be consist of any number between 1 to N inclusive.
Input

 Each testcase contains of a two lines of input, First line will contain, number of people including chef.
Second line will contain array of number A1,A2,A3,..........,ANA1,A2,A3,..........,AN denoting the points of each player at the end of game. 

 Output 

For each testcase, output in a single line containing maximum contiguous group sum.
