A Pastry chef made N pieces of pastries, numbered them 1 through N and arranged them in this order in a row. There are K possible types of flavours (numbered 1 through K); for each valid i, the i-th piece of pastry has a flavour Ai.
The Chef wants to select a contiguous subsegment of the pieces of pastry such that there is at least one flavour which does not occur in that subsegment. Find the maximum possible length of such a subsegment of cakes.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers N and K.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum length of a valid subsegment.

Constraints
1≤T≤1,000 
1≤N≤105
2≤K≤105
1≤Ai≤K for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106

Explanation
In the first test case since we have only 2 flavors,flavor 1 is occuring 3 times and 2 is occuring 2 times.
The maximum subsegment of pastries is of flavor 1 which is 3.
In the second case we have 5 pastries and 3 flavors but the third flavor is not in the list hence whole array is valid answer.
