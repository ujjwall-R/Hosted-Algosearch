Explanation
Test Case 11: Without subscription, the platform allows only 3030 minutes of duration. Since Chef needs to conduct a lecture of 5050 minutes, he needs to buy the subscription.
Test Case 22: Without subscription, the platform allows 3030 minutes of duration. Since Chef needs to conduct a lecture of 33 minutes only, he does not need to buy the subscription.
Test Case 33: Without subscription, the platform allows 3030 minutes of duration. Since Chef needs to conduct a lecture of 3030 minutes only, he does not need to buy the subscription.
Test Case 44: Without subscription, the platform allows only 3030 minutes of duration. Since Chef needs to conduct a lecture of 8080 minutes, he needs to buy the subscription.
