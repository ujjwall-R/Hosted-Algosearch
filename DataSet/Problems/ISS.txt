Zanka finds fun in everyday simple things. One fine day he got interested in a very trivial sequence. Given a natural number kk, he considers the sequence Ai=k+i2Ai=k+i2 so that the terms are
k+1,k+4,k+9,k+16,…k+1,k+4,k+9,k+16,…
Now to make things more interesting, he considers the gcd of consecutive terms in the sequence, then takes the sum of the first 2k values. More formally, he wants to compute
2k∑i=1gcd(Ai,Ai+1)
Denote this sum by S. Zanka wants you to print  the number S for each k.
Input

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Descriptions of test cases follow.
The only line of each test case contains a single integer k.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the sum S for the given k.
Constraints

1≤T≤106
1≤k≤106

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (20 points): t≤103,k≤103
Subtask #2 (80 points): Original Constraints

                        Sample Output 1
                        





6


Explanation
The first 2k+1 terms of the sequence A are 2,5,10.
So the answer is gcd(2,5)+gcd(5,10)=1+5=6
