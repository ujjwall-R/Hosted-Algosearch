 
Rahul has been given a new task.
He has been given N points on the x-axis, X1,X2,...,XN.
Now he is being asked Q queries. Each query gives him his position on the x-axis X, and asks him the sum of distances from his position and the N points.
As the sum can be quite large, he has been told to print the answer modulo 7630367.
He has written a program to calculate every query, but it seems to be giving him vague answers. 
Help him... 

 
Flawed code

#include  
#define ll long long
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int n,x,q;
    cin>>n>>q;
    int a[n+1],b[n+1],mod=7630367;
    for(int i=0;i!=n;i++){
        cin>>x;
        a[x]++;b[x]++;}
    ll upd=0;
    for(int i=0;i!=n+1;i++){
        upd=a[i]%mod;a[i]=(a[i-1]+upd)%mod;}
    upd=0;
    for(int i=n;i>=0;i--){
        upd=b[i]%mod;b[i]=(b[i+1]+upd)%mod;}
    while(q--){cin>>x;printf("%lld",(a[x]+b[x])%mod);}}


Input

The first line of the input contains two integers N denoting the number of points on x-axis, Q denoting number of queries.
The second line contains N space-separated integers X1, X2, ..., XN denoting the points on x-axis.

The next Q lines contains a single integer X, denoting the new position of Rahul
 
Output

For each query, output a single line containing the answer.

 
Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
1 ≤ Q ≤ 1000000
1 ≤ Xi, X ≤ 1000000

 
Example
