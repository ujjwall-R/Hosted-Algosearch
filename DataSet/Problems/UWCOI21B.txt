Salmon received an array AA of size NN and an array BB of size MM for Christmas. He would like to move all the elements in B to A using a special method described below.
While B is not empty, Salmon does the following operations in order:

Remove and store the leftmost element off of B (let's call this element X).
Place X at the start of A.
Keep swapping X and the element to the right of it repeatedly until X is at the rightmost position of A or X is greater or equal to the element to the right of it.

Before performing the operations, Salmon can rearrange both A and B in any order once. He would like to do as little work as possible -- determine the minimum possible amount of swaps.
Input:
The first line of input will consist of a two space-separated integers, N and M (1≤N,M≤2∗105).
The next line will consist of N space-separated integers, with the i-th input representing A[i] (−109≤A[i]≤109).
The next line will consist of M space-separated integers, with the i-th input representing B[i] (−109≤B[i]≤109).
Output:
Output a single integer, the minimum number of swaps required.
Subtasks:

Subtask 1 [15 points]: A[i]=1,B[i]=1 for all i.
Subtask 2 [30 points]: N,M≤103.
Subtask 3 [55 points]: No additional constraints.

Note:
The answer may be greater than the limit for a 32-bit integer. Use long long instead of int for C++ and long for Java. Please check your language documentation for other languages on how to use 64-bit integers. Note that Python solutions won't encounter a problem as it uses BigIntegers by default.

                        Sample Input 1
                        





5 3
10 5 2 5 4
3 1 2



                        Sample Output 1
                        





5


Explanation
Salmon can reorder A to be [2,10,5,4,5] and B to be [1,2,3].
