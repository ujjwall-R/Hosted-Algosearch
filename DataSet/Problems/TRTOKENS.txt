You are given a rooted tree with NN nodes numbered 1,2,…,N1,2,…,N. Node 11 is the root node. Some of the nodes have a token in them. In one move, you can choose a non-root node that has a token, but its parent doesn't, and move the token from this node to its parent. What is the maximum number of moves you can make?
Note: When a token is moved out of a node, the node becomes empty, and other tokens will be able to move there.
Input

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case contains three lines.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N, the number of nodes in the tree.
The second line contains a string s of length N. The character si is 1 if node has a token, and 0 otherwise.
The third line contains N−1 space separated integers, p2,p3,…pN, where pi is the parent of node i.

Output
For each test case, print the maximum number of moves that can be made on a new line.
Constraints

1≤N≤106
For each valid i,  1≤pi<i.
The sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 106.

Subtasks

Subtask 1 (13 points): T≤10,N≤17.
Subtask 2 (18 points): The sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 2000.
Subtask 3 (41 points): The sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 105.
Subtask 4 (28 points): No additional constraints.

Explanation
In the first test case, you can first move a token from node 4 to node 3, and then move a token from node 2 to node 1.
In the second test case, there are no possible valid moves.
