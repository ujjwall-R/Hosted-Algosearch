Raju is a generous man. So, he decided to give people the gifts of there choice to make them happy. He goes to the people, shows them his "decision tree" and asks a simple question. If the person is able to answer correctly then he/she gets the desired gift. Now, Raju has knocked your door and now it's your turn to grab the gift.                                                  
Raju's "decision tree" is a special tree having NN nodes and N−1 edges and each node is having a specific value attached to it. Each node is connected to every other node through a simple path. No two nodes have the same value attached to them. He gives 2 nodes from the tree U,V and 2 numbers L,R and asks to tell the number of nodes on the path between U and V (including U,V) that have the value attached to them lying between L to R inclusive. 
Input:

First-line contains 2 integers N,Q, where N is the number of nodes in the tree and Q is the number of queries.                            
Next line contains N integers denoting the value at each node of the tree                      
Next N−1 lines contain 2 integers each U,V denoting that there is an edge between U and V 
Next Q lines contain Q queries of the form A B L R
let us define last as the answer to the previous query (if it is the first query then last=0), the parameters can be calculated by :
U = ( A Xor last ) % n + 1
V = ( B Xor last ) % n + 1 

Output:
Print the answer of each query in a new line.

2 4
1 5
3 5 2 5          
Sample Output:

Explanation:
U = ( 3 Xor 0 ) % 5 + 1 = 4
V = ( 5 Xor 0 ) % 5 + 1 = 1
