Gaius Julius Caesar, a famous general, loved to line up his soldiers. Overall the army had N1 footmen and N2 horsemen. Caesar thought that an arrangement is not beautiful if somewhere in the line there are strictly more that K1 footmen standing successively one after another, or there are strictly more than K2 horsemen standing successively one after another. Find the number of beautiful arrangements of the soldiers.
Note that all N1+N2 warriors should be present at each arrangement. All footmen are considered indistinguishable among themselves. Similarly, all horsemen are considered indistinguishable among themselves.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains 4 space separated integers N1, N2, K1, K2 - which represent how many footmen and horsemen are there and the largest acceptable number of footmen and horsemen standing in succession, correspondingly.
Output
For each test case, print the number of beautiful arrangements of the army modulo 1000000007 (109+7). That is, print the number of such ways to line up the soldiers, that no more than K1 footmen stand successively, and no more than K2 horsemen stand successively.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 105
2 ≤ N1 ≤ 100
1 ≤ N2 ≤ 100
2 ≤ K1 ≤ 10
1 ≤ K2 ≤ 10

Example
Input:
3
2 1 1 10
2 3 1 2
2 4 1 1
Output:
1
5
0

Explanation
Let's mark a footman as 1, and a horseman as 2.
Example case 1.  The only beautiful line-up is: 121.
Example case 2.  5 beautiful line-ups exist: 12122, 12212, 21212, 21221, 22121
