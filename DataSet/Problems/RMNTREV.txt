Alice initially has a string SS of length NN, and she decides to modify it! Her modification consists of KK steps numbered from 11 to K. In the i-th step, Alice reverses the prefix of length i of S.
For example, suppose Alice starts with S=abferty, and she modifies it via 3 steps, then:

After the first step, abferty→S=abferty
After the second step, abferty→S=baferty
After the third step, baferty→S=faberty
So after 3 steps, her string becomes S=faberty.

After performing her K-step modification, Alice ends up with the string S′. Now she challenges you to find the original string S. Can you do it?
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.
The first line of the test case contains two space-separated integers N and K - the length of the string and the number of steps in Alice's modification.
The second line of the test case contains S′ - the final string obtained after the modification.

Output Format
For each test case, output the original string S.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤106
1≤K≤N
|S′|=N
S′ contains only lowercase alphabets
Sum of N overall cases does not exceed 106.

Explanation

Test case 2: The modification steps from S to S′ is as follow:
1-st step: aababba→S=aababba
2-nd step: aababba→S=aababba
3-rd step: aababba→S=baaabba
4-th step: baaabba→S=aaabbba
5-th step: aaabbba→S=bbaaaba
Test case 3: The modification steps from S to S′ is as follow:
1-st step: wxyz→S=wxyz
2-nd step: wxyz→S=xwyz
3-rd step: xwyz→S=ywxz
4-th step: ywxz→S=zxwy
