It's really a hard time at DUCS, because we're gonna miss our loved seniors. There are nn seniors at DUCS and for each ii (1≤i≤n)(1≤i≤n), the ith senior visits DUCS Ai times every 30 days, but it's not at all concrete so nothing can be said firmly in this regard.
The probability of finding all the seniors at DUCS is known as the Fall in Love probability P. Surprisingly, after a lot of rigorous research, it has been found that this probability can be expressed mathematically using a closed formula, and it does show strange results. And it can be mathematically expressed as P=110nπn∑i=1Ai, where π is …, you know what it is!
Sadly, it can also be proved mathematically that this probability, under the given constraints, can never be equal to 1 (0<P<1).
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer n.
The second line contains n space separated integers A1,A2,…,An.

Output:
For each test case print a single line containing the real number P. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10−6.
Constraints:

1≤T≤105
1≤n≤105
1≤Ai≤30, for each valid i
Sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 106
