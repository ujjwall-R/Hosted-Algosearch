You are given a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. An ordered pair of indices (i,j)(i,j) in this sequence is called a beautiful pair if i≠ji≠j and Ai−AjAi<Ai−AjAj. (Here, division represents real division, e.g. 52 is equal to 2.50.)
Help Chef find the number of beautiful pairs present in the given sequence.
Note: Since the input is large, prefer using fast input methods.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of beautiful pairs present in the given sequence.
Constraints

1≤T≤10
1≤N≤2⋅105
1≤Ai≤106 for each valid i

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (20 points): N≤103
Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints

Explanation
Example case 1: The beautiful pairs of indices are (1,2),(2,1),(2,3),(3,2).

For the pair (1,2): 4−24<4−22 since 0.5<1.
For the pair (2,1): 2−42<2−44 since −1<−0.5.
For the pair (2,3): 2−42<2−44 since −1<−0.5.
For the pair (3,2): 4−24<4−22 since 0.5<1.
