Chozi is, as usual, late for his class and is stuck on a staircase where he is being very skeptic about taking them since some of the stairs are wet and Chozi is wearing very slippery shoes.
There are N stairs, numbered 1 to N, out of which K stairs are wet and the class is at the end of the N - th stair. Chozi can skip 1 or 2 stairs if needed to avoid a wet stair, i.e. if Chozi is on the i-th stair, he can go to i+1-th ,i+2-th ,i+3 - th stair. 
Chozi is not a very punctual student and won't mind skipping a lecture if he cannot avoid all the wet stairs. Help him find the total number of ways in which he can reach the N-th  stair by avoiding all the wet stairs if he only moves forward.
Find this number of possible ways modulo 109+7.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and K.
The second line contains K space-separated integers K1,K2,…,KK where each integer denotes the stair number that is wet.

Output:
For each test case, print a single line. The total ways to reach the N-th stair modulo 109+7. 
Constraints

1≤T≤10
3≤N≤106
0≤K≤N/2
1≤Ki<N

Sample Input:
1
6 2

2 4
Sample Output:
4

EXPLANATION:
The possible ways are:
[1,3,5,6],[3,5,6],[3,6]and[1,3,6]. Hence the answer is 4.
