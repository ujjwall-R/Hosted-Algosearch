You are given positive integers N and D. You may perform operations of the following two types:

add D to N, i.e. change N to N+D
change N to digitsum(N)

Here, digitsum(x) is the sum of decimal digits of x. For example, digitsum(123)=1+2+3=6, digitsum(100)=1+0+0=1, digitsum(365)=3+6+5=14.
You may perform any number of operations (including zero) in any order. Please find the minimum obtainable value of N and the minimum number of operations required to obtain this value.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and D.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing two space-separated integers — the minimum value of N and the minimum required number of operations.

Explanation
Example case 1: The value N=1 can be achieved by 8 successive "add" operations (changing N to 10) and one "digit-sum" operation.
Example case 2: You can prove that you cannot obtain N=1 and N=2, and you can obtain N=3.
The value N=3 can be achieved by one "add" and one "digitsum" operation, changing 9 to 12 and 12 to 3.  
Example case 3: N=1 can be achieved by operations "add", "add", "digitsum", "digitsum": 11→24→37→10→1.
