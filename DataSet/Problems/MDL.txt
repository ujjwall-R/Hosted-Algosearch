You are given a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN of distinct integers. While the sequence contains at least three elements, look at its first three elements, find the median among these elements and delete it. What will the final sequence be?
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing K space-separated integers, where K is the length of the final sequence. For each valid i, the i-th of these integers should be the i-th element of the final sequence.

Constraints

1≤T≤74
3≤N≤19
1≤Ai≤109 for each valid i

Explanation
Example case 1: We remove the element 3 because it is the median of (2,5,3). The final sequence is (2,5).
