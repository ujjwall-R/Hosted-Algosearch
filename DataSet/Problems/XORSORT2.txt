You are given a sequence of distinct non-negative integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.
For every non-negative integer x<2Kx<2K, let's define a function f(x)f(x) as the number of inversions in the sequence A1⊕x,A2⊕x,…,AN⊕x. (An inversion in a sequence X1,X2,…,XN is a pair of indices (i,j) such that i<j and Xi>Xj.)
Consider the sorted sequence of pairs (f(x),x) for all integers x∈[0,2K−1]; a pair (f(x1),x1) is earlier than (f(x2),x2) in this sequence if f(x1)<f(x2), or if f(x1)=f(x2) and x1<x2. You should find the second element (i.e. the number x) of the P-th pair in this sequence. The sequence is indexed from 1.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, K and P.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number x generating the P-th pair in the sorted sequence.

Explanation
Example case 1: The values of f(x) for all 0≤x≤7 are as follows:

x=0: f(0)= number of inversions in [2,0,3,7]=1
x=1: f(1)= number of inversions in [3,1,2,6]=2
x=2: f(2)= number of inversions in [0,2,1,5]=1
x=3: f(3)= number of inversions in [1,3,0,4]=2
x=4: f(4)= number of inversions in [6,4,7,3]=4
x=5: f(5)= number of inversions in [7,5,6,2]=5
x=6: f(6)= number of inversions in [4,6,5,1]=4
x=7: f(7)= number of inversions in [5,7,4,0]=5

The sorted sequence of pairs (f(x),x) is [(1,0),(1,2),(2,1),(2,3),(4,4),(4,6),(5,5),(5,7)]. We should find the P=5-th pair, which is (4,4), so the answer is 4.
