Explanation
Test case 1: There are 2 customers waiting for the haircut and the salon will take 15 minutes for each customer, hence Chef will have to wait for 30 minutes before he can get his haircut.
Test case 2: There are 0 customers waiting for the haircut, therefore the Chef will not have wait to get the haircut.
