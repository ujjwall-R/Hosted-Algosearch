Let f(n,B)f(n,B) be the sum of digits of the integer nn when written in base BB.
More formally, if n=∞∑i=0aiBi where ai is an integer in the range [0,B−1], then f(n,B)=∞∑i=0ai.
Given Q queries, each consisting of three integers n,l and r. Find the value of B corresponding to which f(n,B) is minimum for all l≤B≤r. If there are multiple such values, you can print any of them.
Input Format

The first line contains in single integer Q, the number of queries
Each of the next Q lines contain three space separated integers n,l and r respectively.

Output Format

For each query (n l r), print the value of base B which lies within [l,r] such that f(n,B) is minimum.

Constraints

1≤Q≤103
2≤n≤109
2≤l≤r≤109

Explanation
To compute f(n,B), first write the integer n in the form a0+a1B+a2B2+… such that 0≤ai<B and ai is an integer. It can be shown that such a representation is unique. The sum of the digits is then ∞∑i=0ai (to be computed in base 10).
For example to compute f(216,2), observe that 216=27+26+24+23, and so the sum of digits is 1+1+1+1=4.
Similarly, to compute  f(216,100), write 216 as 2∗100+16 and so the sum of digits is 2+16=18.
Test case 1: We have f(216,2)=f(216,3)=4, f(216,4)=6, f(216,5)=8, f(216,6)=1 and finally f(216,7)=12. Clearly the minimum is obtained when B=6.
Test case 2: Note that f(256,2)=f(256,4) = 1, therefore both the answers 2 and 4 will be considered correct.
Test case 3: f(31,3)=f(31,5)=3 and f(31,4)=7, therefore both the answers 3 and 5 will be considered correct.
