Chef loves dealing with binomial coefficients. Today, he came across an interesting problem, but he is currently busy in the kitchen. Can you help Chef solve this problem?
You are given three positive integers N, p and r. Calculate the sum
S=N∑i=0(pir).
Since this sum could be very large, calculate it modulo 998,244,353.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, p and r.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the sum S modulo 998,244,353.
Constraints

1 \le N \le 10^9
1 \le p \lt 998,244,353
1 \le r \le 10^6

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (5 points):

T = 10
N \le 10^5
r \le 100

Subtask #2 (10 points):

T = 100
r = 2

T = 5
r \le 1,000

Subtask #4 (40 points):

T = 5
r \le 10^5

Subtask 5 (20 points):

T = 2
