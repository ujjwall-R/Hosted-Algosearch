Everyone knows the famous detective Sherlock. He has been handed over a new case of "The Abominable Bride". Each night she kills N people but to irritate 
Sherlock she leaves exactly one people. The way she kills the people is somewhat strange. She makes 1 to N people stand in a line and starts killing 
them. But, in the line when she kills the first person, there's time for the person standing next in line to run away at the end of the line.Again she kills the first 
person and the second one next to him runs to the last of the line. In this way after killing, there is exactly one person standing in the line who is saved and he 
runs to Sherlock to explain the situation each night. Help Sherlock find out the person that will be saved at the end of the massacre.
