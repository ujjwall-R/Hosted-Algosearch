You are given a context free grammar GG and a string SS. Find the minimum Levenshtein distance between S and any string W accepted by G.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers V and R denoting the number of non-terminals and the number of productions of G respectively.
The following R lines describe productions.
Each line starts with an integer T denoting the production type.
If T=0, a space and three space-separated integers X, Y and Z denoting a production X→YZ follow.
If T=1, a space, an integer X, another space and a character c denoting a production X→c follow.
If T=2, a space and a single integer X denoting a production X→ε follows.
The next line contains a single integer ST denoting the starting symbol of G.
Last line contains the string S as explained in statement.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the minimum distance. It is guaranteed that the minimum distance fits in a 64-bit signed integer.
Constraints

1≤V≤60
1≤|S|≤60
1≤R≤256 
0≤X,Y,Z≤V−1
c is an English letter or a decimal digit
S consist of english letters or decimal digit or both.

Example Input
5 7
0 0 1 2
0 0 3 4
2 0
1 1 a
1 3 b
0 4 0 3
0 2 0 1
0 
ababb

Example Output
2

Explanation
The grammar recognizes all even-length palindromes over the alphabet {a,b}. We can transform the given string into "abaaba" with one insertion and one substitution.
