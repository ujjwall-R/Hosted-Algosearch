You are given two integers NN and KK. You may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero): change NN to N−K, i.e. subtract K from N. Find the smallest non-negative integer value of N you can obtain this way.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the smallest value you can get.

Explanation
Example case 1:

First, we change N=5 to N−K=5−2=3.
Then, we have N=3 and we change it to N−K=3−2=1.

Since 1<K, the process stops here and the smallest value is 1.
Example case 2: We change N=4 to N−K=4−4=0. Since 0<K, the process stops here and the smallest value is 0.
Example case 3: Since 2<K initially, we should not perform any operations and the smallest value is 2.
