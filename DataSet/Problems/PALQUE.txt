You are given a string SS. Let the set of strings STST be the set of all distinct contiguous palindromic substrings of S. Each element of ST has a value associated with it which is initially 0. You need to process Q queries which are of the following two types:

1 L R P X: Add X to the values of all palindromes that are substrings of S[1...P] and are of the form T+S[L...R]+rev(T) where rev(T) denotes the reverse of T. Here T can be any string (possibly empty). It is guaranteed that S[L...R] is a palindrome.
2 L R: Print the value of S[L..R]. It is guaranteed that S[L...R] is a palindrome.

Input Format

The first line of input contains the string S.
The second line contains an integer Q - number of queries.
Next Q lines contain description of queries. Each line starts from integer type (1≤type≤2) - the type of the query. 
If type=1, then rest of the line contains integers L,R,P,X.
If type=2, then rest of the line contains integers L,R.

Output Format
For each query of the second type, output the answer to it.
Constraints

1≤len(S)≤105
S consists of lowercase english letters
2≤Q≤105
1≤L≤R≤len(S)
1≤P≤len(S)
1≤X≤109

Explanation
Initially, the set ST={a,b,c,bb,cc,ccc,abba}. Initially, the value associated with all of them is 0.

Query 1: S[1...4]=abba. There does not exist any substring in S[1...3] of the form T+abba+rev(T). So no value is changed.
Query 2: Value of S[1...4]=abba is 0.
Query 3: S[1...4]=abba. The substrings in S[1...4] of the form T+abba+rev(T) are: abba. So value of abba increases from 0 to 228.
Query 4: Value of S[1...4]=abba is 228.
Query 5: S[2...3]=bb. The substrings in S[1...3] of the form T+bb+rev(T) are: bb. So value of bb increases from 0 to 322.
Query 6: Value of S[2...3]=bb is 322.
Query 7: Value of S[1...4]=abba is 228.
Query 8: S[5...5]=c. The substrings in S[1...6] of the form T+c+rev(T) are: c. So value of c increases from 0 to 1337.
Query 9: Value of S[5...6]=cc is 0.
