 
Captain America has requested Tony for a new shield with a different shape to experiment with. Tony decided that he will build a triangular shield for Captain. He first decided to build the traingular frame of the shield. To do so, he has n segments of Vibranium steel alloy, the i-th of them has a length Ai. Since Vibranium is a rare substance, Tony can use exactly 3 segments out of n, such that they form a non degenerate triangular frame. He can not concatenate two segments or change the length of any segment. Help Tony determine if he can use exactly three segments to form a triangular frame or not !!
 
Input

The first line contains a positive integer t, denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n denoting the number of segments Tony has to choose from.
The second line of each test case contains n space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the length of the segments. 

 
Output
For each test case, output in a single line "Yes" if Tony can form a non-degenerate triangular frame using exactly three segments, and "No" otherwise.
 
Constraints

1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
3 ≤ n ≤ 105
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 109
