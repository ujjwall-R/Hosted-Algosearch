A non-negative number is called "SS semi-palindromic" if it is divisible by SS and it is possible to rearrange its digits in such a way that the resulting number is palindromic. If the initial number had D digits (without leading zeroes), consider the number obtained by rearranging to have exactly D digits as well (leading zeroes are allowed).
Compute the number of "S semi-palindromic" numbers smaller than 10K.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers S and K.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the answer modulo 109+7.
