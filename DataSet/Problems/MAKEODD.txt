Vishesh just found an array A having N positive integers. He hates even numbers and would like to make the array full of only odd numbers. To do so, he is allowed to do the following operation.

Pick a positive integer X such that X=2Y for some non-negative integer Y. Then, for all elements Ai in A, if Ai is divisible by X, then we divide Ai by X (in other words, we assign Ai←AiX).

Let's define f(B) as the minimum operations required to make an array B have only odd numbers using the operation described above. Find the sum of f(a) over all subarrays a of A.
Note: A subarray of A is acquired by removing some (possibly none) elements from the beginning and some (possible none) elements from the end of A.
Input Format

The first line of each input contains T - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N - the size of A.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN - the array A.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line the answer to the problem.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤105
1≤Ai≤106
Sum of N over all test cases is not more than 5⋅105

Explanation

Test case 1:
[1] requires 0 operations.
[1,2] requires 1 operation.
[1,2,4] requires 2 operations.
[2] requires 1 operation.
[2,4] requires 2 operations.
[4] requires 1 operation.

Therefore, sum of f(a) over all subarrays a of A is 7.

Test case 2:
[1] requires 0 operations.
[1,2] requires 1 operation.
[1,2,1] requires 1 operation.
[2] requires 1 operation.
[2,1] requires 1 operation.
[1] requires 0 operations.

Therefore, sum of f(a) over all subarrays a of A is 4.
