You are given a sequence A with N elements and Q queries on this sequence. In each query, you are given two indices L and R; you should compute the maximum value of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two elements Ax, Ay satisfying L ≤ x < y ≤ R.

Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN.
Each of the following Q lines contains two space-separated integers L and R describing one query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing the maximum GCD.
Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 104
1 ≤ Q ≤ 5 · 105
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 108 for each valid i
1 ≤ L < R ≤ N

Subtasks

Subtask #1 (25 points): N ≤ 200


Subtask #2 (25 points): Ai ≤ 1,000 for each valid i


Subtask #3 (50 points): original constraints

Explanation
The answers to the queries are GCDs of the following pairs:

query 1: GCD(A1, A2) = 2
query 2: GCD(A1, A2) = 2
query 3: GCD(A1, A4) = 4
query 4: GCD(A2, A3) = 1
query 5: GCD(A2, A4) = 2
query 6: GCD(A3, A4) = 1
