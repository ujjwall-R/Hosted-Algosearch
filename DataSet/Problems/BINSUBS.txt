You have a binary string ss of length NN.
What is the length of the shortest subsequence of s that needs to be erased for the resulting string to be non-decreasing?
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integers N.
The second line contains a single string  s of length N.

Output:
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer − the length of the shortest subsequence that satisfies the property.
Constraints

1≤T≤104
1≤N≤105
The  sum of N over all test cases does not exceed  106
Every character in every string is either 0 or 1.

Explanation
Example case 1: The string is already non-decreasing, so we don't need to remove any elements. Note that we may choose an empty subsequence.
Example case 2: We can remove s3 to get the resulting string 11 which satisfies the condition. 
Example case 3: We can remove s2 and s4 to get the resulting string 111 which satisfies the condition. 
Example case 4: We can remove s1 to get the resulting string 0011 which satisfies the condition. 
Example case 5: We can remove s1, s2 and s3 to get the resulting string 000 which satisfies the condition. Or we can remove s4, s5 and s6 to get 111.
