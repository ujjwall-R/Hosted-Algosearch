A hostel has NN rooms in a straight line. It has to accommodate XX people. Unfortunately, out of these X people, Y of them are infected with chickenpox. Due to safety norms, the following precaution must be taken:

No person should occupy a room directly adjacent to a room occupied by a chickenpox-infected person. In particular, two chickenpox-infected people cannot occupy adjacent rooms.

For example, if room 4 has a chickenpox-infected person, then nobody should occupy rooms 3 and 5. Similarly, if room 1 has a chickenpox-infected person then nobody should occupy room 2. 
What's the minimum value of N for which all the people can be accommodated in the hostel, following the above condition?
Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers X and Y — the total number of people and the number of chickenpox-infected people.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line a single integer — the minimum value of N for which all the people can be accommodated in the hostel.
Constraints

1≤T≤200
1≤X≤1000
0≤Y≤X

Explanation
Note: Below, C represents a room occupied by a chickenpox-infected person, N represents a room occupied by an uninfected person, and _ represents an empty room.
Test case 1: One of the possible ways to accommodate the people in 4 rooms is:
N N N N 
Test case 2: One of the possible ways to accommodate the people in 8 rooms is:
C _ C _ N N _ C 
Test case 3: One of the possible ways to accommodate the people in 5 rooms is:
