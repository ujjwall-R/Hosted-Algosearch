There is a checkered field with 105105 rows (numbered 1 through 105) and 105 columns (numbered 1 through 105). N different cells in this field (numbered 1 through N) are marked; for each valid i, the coordinates of the i-th marked cell are (xi,yi).
A set of cells is suitable if it meets the following conditions:

All marked cells belong to this set.
For any two cells a and b belonging to this set, there is a path between them with length |xa−xb|+|ya−yb| which only visits cells in this set. Each pair of consecutive cells in a path must have a common side.

You need to find the smallest possible size of a suitable set of cells, as well as the number of sets with this smallest size. Since the number of sets may be very large, compute it modulo 109+7.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and T.
N lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers xi and yi.

Output

If T=0, print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest size of a suitable set. 
If T=1, print a single line containing two space-separated integers ― the smallest size of a suitable set and the number of sets with this size modulo 109+7.

Constraints

1≤N≤105
0≤T≤1
1≤xi,yi≤105 for each valid i

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (10 points):

Subtask #3 (60 points): original constraints
Example Input
