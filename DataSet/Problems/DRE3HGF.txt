Dream abstracts the fabric of spacetime as a directed rooted tree (arborescence) with NN nodes (numbered 11 through NN). Node 1 is the root and for each i (1≤i≤N−1), the parent of node i+1 is fi. All edges of this tree are directed away from the root.
Then, Dream employs a magical superpower and adds M directed edges to this tree in such a way that the resulting directed graph remains acyclic (a DAG).
Let's call a node of this DAG an event and further call a simple path on this DAG an era. Dream considers a pair of events (i,j) to be plausible if there is an era whose first event is i and last event is j. Note that i<j does not have to hold for a plausible pair.
Dream now wants you to answer Q queries. In each query, he gives you two positive integers l and r, where l≤r, and he wishes to know the number of plausible pairs of events (i,j) such that l≤i<j≤r.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and M.
The second line contains N−1 space-separated integers f1,f2,…,fN−1.
M lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers u and v describing an additional edge from node u to node v.
The following line contains a single integer Q.
Q lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers l and r describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of plausible pairs (i,j) such that l≤i<j≤r.

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (10 points): the graph is a line ― that is, M=0 and there is a permutation p1,p2,…,pN such that p1=1 and nodes p1,p2,…,pN form a directed path in the tree
Subtask #2 (20 points): M=0
Subtask #3 (30 points): N,Q≤2⋅105
Subtask #4 (40 points): original constraints
