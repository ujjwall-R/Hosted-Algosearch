You are given an array AA of nn integers as input.
You have to answer qq queries.
In each query, you are given two space-seperated integers, ll & rr, as input.
For each query, you have to output "No" (without quotes) in a new line if the sub-array [l,..,r] doesn't contain any integer, with exactly 11 occurrence in that particular sub-array ([l,..r]), otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes).
Output:
For each query, output "No" (without quotes) in a new line if the sub-array [l,..,r] doesn't contain any integer, with exactly 11 occurrence in that particular sub-array ([l,..r]), otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes).
Constraints:

1≤n≤1051≤n≤105
0≤A[i]≤1050≤A[i]≤105
1≤q≤1051≤q≤105
1≤l≤r≤n1≤l≤r≤n (1-indexing)

Sample Input:
4
0 0 3 0
2
1 2
1 4

Sample Output:
No
Yes

Explanation:

For query−1query−1, sub-array ([1,..,2]) contains no element with 1 occurrence, hence the answer is "No".
For query−2query−2, sub-array ([1,..,4]) contains one occurrence of 33, hence the answer is "Yes".
