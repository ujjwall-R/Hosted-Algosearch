Fluffy the Squirrel has reviewed the problems, and assigned a difficulty rating di for each problem. The contest problems must have consecutive problem numbers. This means that the contest problems must have labels x, x + 1, ..., y for two positive  integers x and y. He believes a contest is balanced if there are at least l problems and at most r problems. Additionally, the average difficulty rating of the problems must be at most A. Flippy wants to set A to some real number (which means it might have decimal places) so that Fluffy can choose the problems for the contest in at least k ways, where k is a positive integer. Flippy wants A to be as small as possible. Find the optimal value of A.

 
Input

The first line contains 4 positive integers n, l, r, k, the number of problems, minimum and maximum number of problems in a balanced contest, and the minimum number of ways that Fluffy can select the problems for the contest. The next line contains n space-seperated integers, denoting the difficulty level of the problems. 

 
Output
Output a single real number, A, as explained in the problem statement. The answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error does not exceed 0.01.
 
Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 100000
1 ≤ di ≤ 106

1 ≤ l ≤  r ≤ n
k will not exceed the number of ways to choose the problems when A = 106

Subtasks

Subtask 1 (7 points) : 1 ≤ n ≤ 300
Subtask 2 (13 points) : 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000
Subtask 3 (30 points) : l = 1, r = n
Subtask 4 (50 points) : Original Constraints

 
Example
Input:
5 2 3 4
1 5 3 6 4

Output:
4.33333333

 
Explanation
Example case. Indeed, there are 4 ways to choose the problems so that the average is at most 4.33333333. (or more precisely 13/3, but the error is less than 0.01 so this is accepted) The 4 choices are {1, 5}, {1, 5, 3}, {3, 6, 4}, {5, 3}.
