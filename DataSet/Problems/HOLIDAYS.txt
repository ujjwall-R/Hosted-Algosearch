Explanation
Test case-1: Ved can work on 2-nd, 3-rd and 5-th day earning 2+6+3=11 rupees ≥W rupees. Thus he can take 2 holidays on the 1-st and the 4-th day.
Test case-2: Ved has to work on all days to earn ≥W rupees. Thus he can not take any holidays.
Test case-3: Ved can work on 2-nd day earning 12 rupees ≥W rupees. Thus he can take holiday on the remaining days.
