Chef has a tree with NN vertices (numbered 11 through NN). The tree is rooted at the vertex 11. For each valid ii, the weight of the ii-th vertex is wiwi.
For a vertex uu with depth dd (the root has depth 11), let's denote the sequence of vertices on the path from uu to the root by (v1,v2,…,vd)(v1,v2,…,vd), where v1=uv1=u and vd=1vd=1. Then, let FuFu be the vector (i.e. sequence) (wv1,wv2,…,wvd)(wv1,wv2,…,wvd), where the ii-th element is Fu,i=wviFu,i=wvi for each valid ii.
For any two vertices uu and vv with the same depth dd, let's define the dot product Fu⋅Fv=∑di=1Fu,i⋅Fv,iFu⋅Fv=∑di=1Fu,i⋅Fv,i.
Your task is to answer Q queries. In each query, you are given two vertices u and v with the same depth, and you should find Fu⋅Fv. Since the dot product can be large, compute it modulo 232.
Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
The second line contains N space-separated integers w1,w2,…,wN.
Each of the next N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting that vertices u and v are connected by an edge.
Q lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers u and v describing a query.

Output
For each query, print a single line containing one integer Fu⋅Fv modulo 232.
Constraints

1≤N,Q≤3⋅105
1≤wi≤109 for each valid i
1≤u,v≤N
in each query, u and v have the same depth

Explanation

In the first query, F2=(4,5) and F3=(3,5), so the scalar product is 4⋅3+5⋅5=37.
In the second query, F4=(2,4,5) and F5=(1,4,5), so the scalar product is 2⋅1+4⋅4+5⋅5=43.
