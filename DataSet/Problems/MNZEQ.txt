Joey is given a problem by his friend Chandler. Since he is not good in maths, he told you to help him solve the problem. Can you help Joey to solve the problem.
The problem is that given an array A with N integers, A[0], A[1], A[2], ... , A[N-1], you need to find an integer x, such that the 
expression (A[0] - x)2 + (A[1] - x)2 + ... + (A[N-1] - x)2 is minimum possible.  


Input

The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of integers in the array.
The second line contains N space-separated intergers denoting the array elements.


Output
For each test case output the number x in a new line.
If there are multiple answers output the maximum one.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1000000


Example Input
1
5
6 2 1 9 2


Example Output
4


Explanation
For every possible value of x, x = 4 gives the minimum value (6-4)2 + (2-4)2 + (1-4)2 + (9-4)2 + (2-4)2 = 46.
