A policeman wants to catch a thief. Both the policeman and the thief can only move on a line on integer coordinates between 00 and NN (inclusive).
Initially, the policeman is at a coordinate xx and the thief is at a coordinate yy. During each second, each of them must move to the left or right (not necessarily both in the same direction) by distance exactly equal to K. No one may go to the left of the coordinate 0 or to the right of N. Both the policeman and the thief move simultaneously and they cannot meet while moving, only at the end of each second.
Will the policeman be able to catch the thief if they both move optimally? The thief is caught as soon as the policeman and thief meet at the same position at the same time.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers x, y, K and N.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Yes" if the thief can be caught or "No" if the thief cannot be caught (without quotes).

Explanation
Example case 1: The policeman is at 0 and the thief is at 1. After the 1-st second, the policeman is at 1 and the thief is at 0. After the next second, the policeman is again at 0 and the thief at 1. They cannot end up at the same coordinate.
