Explanation
Test Case 1: Chef wants 3 items where the cost of each item is 4 rupees. To minimise the expenditure, Chef can pay for 2 items and get the third item for free. This way, the total money required is 4⋅2=8 rupees.
Test Case 2: To minimise the expenditure, Chef can do the following:

Purchase 2 items for 2⋅2=4 rupees and get the third one free. Thus, the total number of items is 3.
Purchase 1 item for 2⋅1=2 rupees. Now Chef has total 4 items.

Thus, the minimum money required to buy 4 items is 4+2=6 rupees.
Test Case 3: To minimise the expenditure, Chef can do the following:

Purchase 2 items for 3⋅2=6 rupees and get the third one free. Thus, the total number of items is 3.
Purchase 2 items for 3⋅2=6 rupees. Chef gets a third item for free. Now Chef has total 6 items which is greater than his requirement of 5 items. 

Chef wanted to buy at least 5 items. The minimum money required for that is 6+6=12 rupees.
Test Case 4: To minimise the expenditure, Chef can do the following:

Purchase 2 items for 1⋅2=2 rupees and get the third one free. Thus, the total number of items is 3.
Purchase 2 items for 1⋅2=2 rupees and get the third one free.. Now Chef has total 6 items. 

Thus, the minimum money required to buy 6 items is 2+2=4 rupees.
