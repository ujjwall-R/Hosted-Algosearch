You are given a sequence of positive integers A0,A1,…,AN−1A0,A1,…,AN−1 and a sequence of non-negative integers C0,C1,…,CN−1C0,C1,…,CN−1. Let's denote M=998244353. You know that for
Ci=N−1∑j=0BjAijmodM
holds for each valid i, with some coefficients B0,B1,…,BN−1 (such that 0≤Bi<M for each i). Your task is to find these coefficients.
It is possible to prove that under the given constraints, the solution is unique.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N. 
The second line contains N space-separated integers A0,A1,…,AN−1.
The third line contains N space-separated integers C0,C1,…,CN−1. 

Output
Print a single line containing N space-separated integers B0,B1,…,BN−1.
Constraints

1≤N≤60,000
1≤Ai<M for each valid i
0≤Ci<M for each valid i
Ai≠Aj for each valid i,j (i≠j)
