Explanation

Test case 11: Chef has no pairs to sell, so the amount obtained is 00.
Test case 22: The amount earned by selling a pair is 00, so the total amount obtained is 00.
Test case 33: Chef can sell 1010 pairs of slippers, each giving 10001000 rupees, so the total amount earned is 1000⋅10=10000.
Test case 4: Chef has 10 slippers of which 7 are left and 3 are right. Therefore Chef can sell a maximum of 3 pairs and in total can get at most 3⋅1=3.
