Chef is very happy today because he got an offer from Gordon Ramsay himself to work for him in London. Chef wants to prepare a delicious cake for Gordon to impress him, but he does not know that Gordon Ramsay is not easy to impress.
Gordon cut Chef's cake into NN small slices (numbered 11 through NN), placed in a row in such a way that for each valid i, slices i and i+1 are adjacent. Note that slices N and 1 are not adjacent. For each valid i, the i-th slice has taste Ai. Gordon wants to put special toppings on some slices and then ask Chef to group all slices into K clusters in such a way that the slices in each cluster form a contiguous sequence and the sweetness of the cake is maximum possible.
For each valid i, let's denote the topping on the i-th slice by ti (ti=0 if there is no topping on this slice); the sweetness of this slice is ti⋅Ai, so the sweetness of a slice without any special topping is 0.
The sweetness of a cluster is the total (summed up) sweetness of all slices in this cluster. Let's denote the sweetnesses of all clusters by S1,S2,…,SK. The sweetness of the whole cake is computed as S1∗S2∗…∗SK, where the operation ∗ is defined in the following way: for any non-negative integers x and y such that x≥y,
x∗y=y∗x=⌊log2(x)⌋∑n=02n(⌊x2n⌋mod2)(⌊y2n⌋mod2).
It can be proven that this operation is associative, i.e. (x∗y)∗z=x∗(y∗z).
You should answer Q queries. In each query, you are given the toppings on all slices and the number of clusters K. Tell Chef the maximum possible sweetness of the cake!
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
The next line contains a single integer Q.
For each query, two lines follow. The first of these lines contains a single integer K. The second line contains N space-separated integers t1,t2,…,tN.

Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the maximum sweetness.
Constraints

1≤Q≤10
1≤N≤105
1≤K≤105
1≤Ai≤1015 for each valid i
0≤ti≤10 for each valid i
in each query, the number of slices with toppings does not exceed 50

Explanation
For the first query, Chef can choose clusters in the following way: cluster 1 contains slices 1 and 2, cluster 2 contains slices 3 through 7 and cluster 3 contains slices 8 through 10. The sweetness of the cake is (15⋅2+5⋅3)∗(26⋅1+4⋅4+3⋅7+13⋅1+5⋅5)∗(5⋅1+27⋅1+11⋅1)=33.
