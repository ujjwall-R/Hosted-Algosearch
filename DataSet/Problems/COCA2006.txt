A country has total BB Covid Beds under its control.There are total NN states in the country.Each state can demand at most KiKi,  1≤i≤N  beds so that they can successfully use them for treatment of  Covid Patients. Now,head of the country wants to allocate all the B beds to different states. He wants to know the number of ways to do so.Each state might also get 0 beds.Help him!
Since total number of ways can be large, output the answer modulo  109+7.
Input:

First line will contain two space separated integers B,N representing number of beds and number of states respectively.Then N lines follow. 
Second line contains N  space separated integers Ki. 

Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line answer modulo 109+7.
Constraints

1≤B≤100000
1≤N≤50
0≤Ki≤B

Sample Input:
   4 3
   2 2 3

Sample Output:
   8
