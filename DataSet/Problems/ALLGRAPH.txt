You are given a weighted directed graph of NN vertices and N2N2 edges, and an array AA of length N. Initially, every ordered pair of vertices (u,v) is connected by a directed edge u→v of cost Au (this also includes self-loops). 
Then there were M changes in edges' weights such that the weight of the directed edge u→v is now equal to c. You are asked to find the sum of the lengths of the shortest paths over all ordered pairs of distinct vertices.
Input

The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
The third line of each test case contains a single integer M.
The next M lines contain information about the changed edges in the u v c format.

Output
For each test case, output the sum of the lengths of the shortest paths over all ordered pairs of vertices.
Constraints

1≤N≤106
0≤M≤2000
0≤Ai,c≤106
1≤u,v≤N
The sum of N over all tests does not exceed 106.
The sum of M over all tests does not exceed 2000.
It is guaranteed that the weight of the edge u→v was changed at most once.

Subtasks
Subtask #1 (8 points, time limit 1 second): The sum N for all tests does not exceed 500.
Subtask #2 (22 points, time limit 1 second): Each vertex belongs to at most one changed edge (in other words, the edges do not overlap).
Subtask #3 (30 points, time limit 1 second): The sum M for all tests does not exceed 500.
Subtask #4 (40 points, time limit 4.5 seconds): original constraints.

Explanation
Example case 1: The lengths of the shortest paths between vertices u and v are Au and the answer is 2⋅(2+4+1)=14.
Example case 2: The lengths of the shortest paths between the vertices u and v are equal to Au except for the pair of vertices (3,4) for which the distance is 2.
