 
Fluffy the squirrel and Flippy the bird are good friends. One day, they decided to play a game with two stacks of coins. There are n coins on each stack. A turn consists of choosing a nonempty stack and taking the coin on top of the stack. Note that one must take a coin each move. The game ends when all the coins have been taken.

Fluffy moves first. Each coin has a value ci associated to it. When a player takes a coin with value x, his score increases by x. The value of the game is defined as Fluffy's score - Flippy's score. For example, if Fluffy has score 3 and Flippy has score 9, then the value of the game is 3 - 9 = -6. Determine the value of the game if both players play optimally.

Note : Flippy and Fluffy has X-ray eyes. They can see the values on all the coins in the stack before the game starts.
 
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer n, denoting the number of coins on each stack. The next line contains n space-seperated integers, denoting the values of coins ai of the first stack, where the first integer is the value of the coin on top of the stack and the last integer is the value of the coin at the bottom of the stack. The next line contains n space-seperated integers, denoting the values of coins bi of the second stack, where the first integer is the value of the coin on top of the stack and the last integer is the value of the coin at the bottom of the stack.

Output
Output a single integer, the value of the game if Flippy and Fluffy both play optimally.
Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 5000
-109 ≤ ai, bi ≤ 109

Subtasks

Subtask 1 (33 points) 1 ≤ n ≤ 20
Subtask 2 (67 points) 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000

Example
Input:
2
6 5
-1 -2

Output:
2

 
Explanation
Example case 1. With optimal play, the game will go like this :

Turn 1 : Fluffy chooses the coin with value 6.

Turn 2 : Flippy chooses the coin with value 5.

Turn 3 : Fluffy chooses the coin with value -1.

Turn 4 : Flippy chooses the coin with value -2.

Thus, Fluffy's score is 6 - 1 = 5 while Flippy's score is 5 - 2 = 3. The value of the game is 5 - 3 = 2.
