A string X is a multiple of string Y if X consists of one or more copies of Y concatenated together. For e.g. 'abab' and 'ab' are multiples of 'ab'. Crazy Girl is interested in some specific properties of strings and needs to find multiples of a smaller string in a bigger string, but it is getting too cumbersome to do for large texts. Given two strings B and A, she wants to find all the substrings of string A which are multiples of string B and cannot be extended further to the left or right and are of maximal length. Help her by writing a program to automate the task. Output the location of the multiples of string B in the form of pairs (a, b) where a denotes the starting position of the multiple in string A (1 - based) and b denotes the number of times string B is repeated in the multiple.
Input
The first line contains the string A and the second line contains the string B.
Output
Output the required pairs (a, b) in decreasing order of a and output -1 if string B is not a substring of string A.
Constraints
1 <= |A| <= 10^6
1 <= |B| <= |A|
 The strings A and B consist only of lowercase letters 'a' - 'z'
Example
Input:
aabaabaaabaaaba
Output:
4 21 1Explanation:The pairs (8, 1) and (4, 1) are not reported because they can be extended further to the left and right respectively to form a multiple with two copies of string B.
