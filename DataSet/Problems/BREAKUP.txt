Chef has been into many relationships,loves breaking up and blocking his ex-girlfriend's number.He had a breakup recently with Chefina and was trying to forget her phone number but wasn’t able to.His friend Dr.Krishna,a neuroscience professor suggested chef to try a simple trick.The trick was to take parts of the number which have the same digits consecutively and delete them in one go.
Formally,a K digit number takes K operations to be deleted previously.But now with this trick,you can delete some contiguous part of a number in one operation,if all the digits are the same.
We define an operation as deleting some contiguous part of a number which has the same consecutive digits.
Chef has had many breakups till now,so actually speaking he needs to forget many numbers as such.He can concatenate his first girlfriend’s number with his second girlfriend’s number and can delete it as whole.But he should make sure that he doesn’t concatenate his first girlfriend’s number with his third girlfriend’s number which turns out to be an injustice to his second girlfriend.
In simple words,he can concatenate numbers in the order of his breakups and then delete them as a whole number or carry on with deleting the numbers individually.
Chef wants to know the minimum number of operations it will take for him to delete all the numbers of his ex girlfriends.Help him to do so.
Given N positive integers, find the minimum number of operations required to delete all of them. 
Input:

First-line will input T,number of test cases.
The next pair of lines will input N and the respective numbers A1,A2…AN.

Output:
For every test case,output the required minimum number of operations to delete all of the numbers.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 30
1 ≤ Ai < 1010

Sample Input:
2
3

123  456  677
4
90071  5111  23443  22
Sample Output:
7

8
EXPLANATION:
Sample case 1:
123 can be deleted separately taking 3 operations.
456 and 677 can be concatenated and deleted taking 4 operations since in 456677,‘66’ and ‘77’ can be deleted together.
So, the total number of operations would be 3+4=7
Sample case 2:
90071 can be concatenated with 5111 and deleted using 5 operations.
23443 can be concatenated with 22 and deleted using 3 operations.
So, the total number of operations would be, 5+3=8
