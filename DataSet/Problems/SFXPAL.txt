Consider an alphabet with SS characters. Find the number of strings with length NN containing only characters from this alphabet which do not have any palindromic suffix with length greater than 1. Since this number may be very large, compute it modulo M.
Input
The first and only line of the input contains three space-separated integers N, S and M. 
Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the number of strings.
Constraints

1≤N≤1,000
1≤S≤M−1
2≤M≤230−1
M is a prime

Example Input
3 3 13

Example Output
12

Explanation
Let's suppose that the alphabet is {a,b,c}. Then, the strings are "cca", "cab", "bba", "aac", "acb", "cba", "bac", "ccb", "bbc", "aab", "bca", "abc".
