# ALGOsearch

ALGOsearch is a Search Engine designed specifically for Data Structure and Algorithm questions in platforms like codechef and codeforces.

## Web Application

It uses [tf-idf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) Algorithm to implement search. The server is live on [https://algosearchujjwal.herokuapp.com/](https://algosearchujjwal.herokuapp.com/).

## Installation [development]
 
### Dependencies

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Local Building
Clone or unzip the [repository](https://github.com/ujjwall-R/Hosted-Algosearch.git).
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ujjwall-R/Hosted-Algosearch.git
cd Hosted-Algosearch
``` 
Install the dependency modules for both server and client side of the application. The client side is a [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) app built using  [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).
```bash
npm install
cd client
npm install
cd ..
```
### Rebuilding the DataSet [optional]
The DataSet is already build in markup: ```./DataSet```. Anyways you can rebuild the DataSet if you wish. Give the problem tags to build the dataset.
#### Mac/Linux:
```bash
cd DataSet
rm -rf IDF.txt TFIDF.txt keywords.txt magnitude.txt problem_titles.txt problem_urls.txt Problems
mkdir Problems
python -u scrapper.py
```
After building the DataSet for problem tags of your choice, buid the TF IDF data. Note that you have opted to build your own corpus. This may take some time.
```bash
node calc.js
cd ..
```
### Usage
Now you are ready to go and start the web application. In the root directory, start the server.
```bash
nodemon index.js
```
Start the react app in another terminal.
```bash
cd client
npm start
```
Visit your localHost address where the client side app is running and enjoy searching.
